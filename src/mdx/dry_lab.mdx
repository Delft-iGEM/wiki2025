# MD simulation of MS2 hexamer (2xAB + CC dimers)

## Research goal and motivation
For the purpose of inducing a robust immune response, our iGEM project aims to hijack *E. coli*’s cellular machinery to produce an mRNA vaccine directly in the gut of chickens. We plan to encapsulate an mRNA antigen molecule in an MS2 Virus-Like Particle (VLP). However, while MS2 VLPs have already been developed as vaccine technology [1], no testing has previously been done for their stability under the gut environment. Thus, it is crucial to have a framework to test VLP stability to ensure they can stay stable under variable conditions, both cytosolic as well as in the gut conditions.  
We developed this Dry Lab model with the sole goal of examining how different salt conditions and temperatures affect the structural properties of the MS2 VLP. While VLP stability could be empirically tested in the lab, such screening experiments are often time consuming and do not provide mechanistic understanding. Thus, to fully capture the complexity of the MS2 molecular structure we opted to use atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD). Our MD platform provides a framework for better understanding the stability of MS2 VLPs and for the study of future modifications, such as Cell Penetrating Peptides (which would assist the uptake of VLPs by surrounding cells).

## Procedure

### Overview of the procedure
We performed MD simulation on a hexamer section of an MS2 VLP that contains all relevant dimer types of the MS2 VLP. Using the **Amber** software package we parameterized our system, introducing a representative protein force field, box dimensions, solvation and initializing ion amounts for the 8 different salt concentrations we wanted to test. Following this step, we ran a standard MD production pipeline with the **GROMACS** software package which we also set up three different temperature conditions with to be tested. Using the same software we then analyzed our MD output for its RMSD, RMSF, Hydrogen bonds as well as the interaction energy between the constitutive dimers, to get insight into any structural changes observed over the conditions we tested.  

### General outline of implementation
1. Set up an MS2 hexamer (2 AB dimers and 1 CC dimer) structure configuration  
2. Introduce necessary simulation parameters (e.g., box parameters, solvation, ion amount, force field, temperature)  
3. Perform energy minimization and equilibration  
4. Run the MD simulation  
5. Post-process resulting trajectories  
6. Analyze simulation (e.g., RMSD, RMSF, H-bonds, Energy)

## Description of the system
The MS2 VLPs are icosahedral capsids composed of 180 monomers in three different conformations A, B or C. These monomers form dimers, either as heterodimeric AB or as homodimer CC. The presence of both AB and CC is crucial for the structure to properly self-assemble. The different dimers form regular patterns with 5-fold symmetry interactions between AB dimers and 6-fold symmetry interactions between AB and CC dimers. While a complete picture of the structural stability of this structure would only be achieved by simulating a whole VLP such a task is computationally far too demanding to capture with MD. However, since an MS2 VLP is composed of only two types of dimers with two types of dimer-dimer interactions, an informative picture of this structure’s properties can be captured in a hexamer containing two AB and one CC dimer. A hexamer like this contains 774 residues which is computationally feasible for MD.  

Next, we specified the condition types to be tested in this module. While the gut can contain a diverse and dynamic ion content, we recognized **Sodium** as one of the most essential ions whose concentration can vastly differ in different gut regions and different physiological states, from as high as 150 mM to as low as 30 mM [2]. Thus, we decided to screen 30 mM, 40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM and 150 mM salt concentration. Additionally, temperature can potentially influence the stability of VLPs and thus we decided to explore 3 relevant temperature conditions for our concept: **18°C**, which is the temperature at which we successfully induced *E. coli* to produce VLPs; **37°C**, as the optimal *E. coli* growth condition as well as the body temperature of humans; and **42°C**, the body temperature of chickens.

## Description of the parametrization
To set up the parametrization for an MD simulation of the MS2 hexamer, the **tleap** tool from AmberTools 24.8 [ ]. To model the MS2 hexamer, the **ff19SB** force field was used. The structure was solvated in a box of water, modelled with the explicit **OPC water model** [ ], padding the hexamer with 10 Å. Different neutralizing ion amounts were added, with the 8 already described salt concentrations or 150 mM if a temperature condition was being screened. The resulting parametrized Amber files were further converted to GROMACS format using **ParmEd 4.3.0** [ ].

## Description of MD conditions, postprocessing
Next, using the **GROMACS 2024.1** software suite, an MD production, post-processing and analysis were performed. All these processes were run on the Phase 2 **DelftBlue** supercomputer. As a first step of the production process, an energy minimization was carried out until a maximum force of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1 was reached using the **steepest descent algorithm**. In this process, equations of motion were numerically integrated with a time step of 2 fs using the **Verlet leapfrog algorithm**. Molecular coordinates were updated every 10 ps. Van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions were described with a cutoff of 1 nm. Additionally, to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions, we used the **particle-mesh Ewald summation** with fourth-order cubic interpolation and a grid spacing of 0.16 nm.  

Furthermore, the system was equilibrated for 100 ps in the **NVT ensemble**. This was achieved using the **modified Berendsen thermostat** until 300 K equilibrium temperature was reached if testing for salt conditions otherwise the corresponding 3 screening temperatures were used (315 K, 310 K or 291 K). Following this, the hexamer system was equilibrated in the **NpT ensemble** to pressure of 1 bar by implementing a **Parrinello-Rahman barostat** [ ]. At this stage the system went through production for approximately 600 ns. During this process hydrogen bonds were constrained using the **LINCS algorithm** [ ].  

To account for the periodic boundary conditions, standard for MD, the command `gmx trjconv -pbc` with the *whole* and *no_jump* options were used on the raw MD production output. Using `gmx trjconv -skip`, the processed MD were additionally compressed by a factor of 100 or 1000 for the resulting output to be used when dealing with more computationally demanding visualization or analysis.

## [Paragraph analysis procedure]
As part of analyzing the resulting MD simulation the **Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)** and **Hydrogen Bonds** of the total protein as well as the **Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF)** of the protein-backbone atoms were all measured over the whole uncompressed MD output. Three replicate simulations for each condition tested were analyzed. Additionally, to measure the individual binding energies between dimers, the **Generalized Born and Surface Area continuum solvation** method was used through the **gmxMMPBSA** environment [ ].

## Results

### Visualization and overview
After postprocessing and down sampling our MD, we were able to visualize it using the **VMD 1.9.4** software. We aligned the backbone over the time of the simulation, so translational motion of the protein is not shown, and colored with different colors as *NewCartoon* all the different fragments of the protein. Based on observations we were able to recognize that the structure is relatively stable and doesn’t dissociate over the 600 ns timespan of our simulation. Nevertheless, to validate the structural stability of our system we further examined 4 different quantities — **Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)**, **Hydrogen bond count**, **backbone Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF)** and **dimer-dimer binding energy**.

### RMSD
As part of our analysis pipeline we first measured the total RMSD of our MS2 hexamer. This quantity allows us to track if a native stable state is reached of the system and validate whether the observed structural properties reflect the molecular system rather than being artifacts of equilibration. Additionally, RMSD trends can generally reveal large-scale conformational changes, domain motions, or relaxation processes occurring during the trajectory.  
For all conditions a plateau was reached in the first 200 ns while already in the first 20 ns the system relaxed out from its initial equilibrated state. No noticeable differences were observed for the different conditions regarding RMSD. For all conditions tested there were no Fig signs of large scale conformational changes, as expected for this structure.

### Hydrogen bonds
We analyzed the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the structure. We visualized this quantity through a histogram that shows the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonds from the whole timespan of the MD simulation. Not surprisingly all of them follow a Gaussian distribution. For most salt conditions no apparent changes were observed. However, interestingly for the lowest concentration of 30 mM a noticeably lower mean peak was observed. On the other hand, the temperature showed visible effect on the hydrogen bond distribution. While 37°C and 42°C showed relatively similar distributions, the 18°C noticeably shifted the peak of the Gaussian to the right. This reflects more persistent hydrogen bond formation as expected when thermal fluctuations are less present.

### Backbone RMSF
We analyzed the RMSF over all residues of the 6 MS2 protein backbone chains to study what is the influence of salt concentration and temperature on them. For all conditions, the observed RMSF aligned consistently with what is known about the general secondary structure of MS2. Protein regions with well-defined secondary structure such as alpha helices or beta strands aligned with regions of low fluctuation, while peaks of fluctuation aligned with terminal regions or loops between structured elements. These observations further validated our MD procedure.  

In our RMSF analysis, we observe that one of the regions with higher fluctuation levels over all chains and conditions was the **AB loop**, colored in cyan on Fig. # and represented by the first RMSF peak after the N-terminal region. These loops are of particular relevance as they face the outer side of the viral capsid and can thus be a future target for **Cell Penetrating Peptide (CPP)** insertion. A CPP insertion like this can facilitate the uptake of VLPs by gut cells and induce immune response. Exactly because of their outer location they would be expected to have higher fluctuation levels.  

> Fig. #

Interestingly when examined over the screened temperature conditions, the AB loops showed noticeably higher fluctuations for 37°C and 42°C compared to 18°C. This is not particularly surprising as higher temperature would directly result in more thermal fluctuations and thus higher RMSF in more flexible regions of the protein. Surprisingly, however most often 42°C didn’t result in noticeably higher fluctuations than 37°C. In fact in most cases MS2 was observed to have a higher fluctuations for 37°C. In contrast however, in the B2 monomer all temperatures showed indistinguishable levels of fluctuation (see Fig.). A similar pattern, was observed for other highly fluctuating regions in the MS2 backbone.  

> Fig. Caption  

Somewhat similar to the temperature response, no straightforward relationship between RMSF and the salt concentration was observed. However, interestingly, 50 mM salt concentration seems to result in the highest level of fluctuation for most chains and B2 in particular. The fluctuations increase for the first three lowest salt concentrations and then begin to drop down after 50 mM, but around 80 mM again begin to steadily rise.  

> Fig. AB loop region RMSF relation to salt.  

Another interesting observation from the RMSF plot is that a wide peak of fluctuation is observed approximately between residue 66 and 80 (marked green on Fig. #). In A and C monomers, this region surprisingly contains regularly structured beta strands with a short three amino acid beta loop in between them. However, despite the regular secondary structure of this region, it is positioned on the side of the MS2 hexamer and would take part with other MS2 hexamers in the overall VLP structure. Thus this pinpoints a limitation of our hexamer simplification, specifically for this region of the MS2 backbone. Since there are no neighboring hexamers this beta strand structure can freely move and thus has high fluctuation levels. However, in a complete VLP assembly this would not be expected as this region would interact with the same protein structure of other neighboring MS2 dimers.  

However, our RMSF analysis provide

### Dimer-dimer energy measurement
To gain more insight regarding the interaction energy between individual monomers we additionally performed interaction energy measurement, using **gmxMMPBSA**. We tried to measure this energy for both the AB–AB as well as the AB–CC interaction over all examined salt and temperature conditions. … *(TBD after the simulation is run on Monday)*
