## Who?
Eline Kamerik is a veterinarian with practical experience in the poultry sector, including laying hens and backyard chickens.

## Why?
We wanted to gain a veterinarian's perspective on the realities of poultry vaccination to ensure Snaccine aligns with established field practices. We focused on administration routes, dosing at scale, and standard HPAI communication protocols.

## Impact on Snaccine
Eline told us that drinking water administration is the preferred and most practical standard, since it is far more scalable than injections. She also confirmed that the epithelial lining of chicken gut is exceptionally good at absorbing vaccination. This input validated our general design choice to administer the vaccine orally.

However, Eline also noted that the dilution of the vaccination is far easier and more reliable in water than in feed applications. The dilution ensures that a good flock-result can be achieved, although individual animals consume different amounts. To help farmers track consumption, a dye is sometimes added to the water, which temporarily tints the birds' beaks as a visual confirmation of intake.

To take this into consideration, our team would have to assess the homogeneity and effectiveness of mixing Snaccine into the feed; or change formulation methods to adjust Snaccine for water delivery. Nonetheless, Eline successfully confirmed our application of oral delivery, and herd based immunity.
