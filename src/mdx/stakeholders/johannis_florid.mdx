# Johannis Floris

## Who?
Johannis Floris is a farmer near Rotterdam who manages a mixed flock of chickens and ducks. He represents the crucial perspective of an end-user.

## Why?
We consulted Johannis to understand the practical needs, and communication preferences for a product like Snaccine.

## Impact on Snaccine
Johannis provided clear feedback on real-world use. He told us that a pill format is unsuitable because birds will peck and crush it. Instead, a powder or mix-in format for feed or water would be far more practical and effective. He also wants a simple, clear leaflet specifying the dose, mixing instructions, and potential side effects, with guidance for both chickens and ducks. He places his trust primarily in his veterinarian and fellow farmers, rather than government authorities or complex scientific reports, which he feels do not reflect everyday farm life.

His input directly shaped the end-user aspects of our project. We defined the information on instruction pamphlet, decided to add pictograms, and a pre-measured scoop. This consultation also reinforced our plan to share information through trusted channels such as veterinary endorsements.
