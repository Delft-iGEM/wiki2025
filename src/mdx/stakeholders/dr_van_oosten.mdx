# Dr. ir. Luuk van Oosten

## Who?
Dr. ir. Luuk van Oosten is currently a Quality Control Scientist and QC CMC  lead at Batavia Biosciences. He tailors release test strategies for early and late clinical phase products across various scales. 
## Why?
We consulted Luuk twice to translate Snaccine from concept to a viable product.

## Impact on Snaccine
In the first meeting Dr. van Oosten informed us about Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and surrounding regulations. We iterated over this material in a second meeting, where we addressed challenges of manufacturing such as genetic stability, scale-up variability, and downstream processing. To address this, we outlined a downstream purification process to ensure product purity, specifically focusing on endotoxins. This is described in our Iteration Loop 4.

A key decision stemming from this meeting was changing the plan for formulation and phage stability. Instead of pre-selecting a method like freeze-drying or oil encapsulation, we decided that input from end-users must inform the final choice, such that external conditions are integrated.
