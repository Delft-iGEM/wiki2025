# Erik de Jonge (AVINED)

## Who?
Erik de Jonge is a Policy Advisor for poultry health and antibiotic use at AVINED, the Dutch national trade organization representing the poultry and egg sector. They act as the voice of the industry, focusing on economic viability, market access, and policy influence.

## Why?
We consulted with them to understand the economic barriers that prevent the adoption of a new avian influenza vaccine, regardless of its technical merits. Moreover, we wanted to gain insights into the industries opinion on culling and vaccination.

## Impact on Snaccine
We learned that the biggest obstacle is trade. Erik estimated that 90% of the vaccination hurdle is caused by trade constraints, especially with non-EU partners. The uncertain reaction of importers creates major economic risk. In this regard, Erik highlighted France's experience after starting duck vaccination as a clear warning for the EU poultry sector. Erik also confirmed that surveillance requirements for vaccinated flocks, such as weekly checks, add significant pressure on producers.

### Quote
> "Yeah, for 90% it's trait because we do not see any problems with the chickens... But especially trade, you see that, and it's not only in the Netherlands, also in other countries, you see that they are starting to think about vaccination, but they are very concerned about the effects on trade."
