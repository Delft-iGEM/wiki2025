# RIVM, GMO Office

## Who?
Two specialists from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), particularly the GMO Office. Their expertise covers risk assessment of laboratory work, biocontainment, and environmental release of GMOs.

## Why?
We consulted RIVM to understand how Snaccine would be classified under Dutch and EU GMO law, which hazards to prioritize, and which Safe-by-Design measures would be most impactful.

## Impact on Snaccine
RIVM confirmed that the entire product, including the virus-like particles (VLPs), will be regulated as a single GMO. We also learned that environmental shedding of phages is the primary hazard. For this, we must prove that Snaccine is either fully contained or clears from the environment within a specific timeframe. This influenced our SbD principles, leading us to prioritize host-specific and non-replicative bacteriophages to minimize shedding. Since the project was initially designed for replicative phages, we created a large discussion of pros and cons in the integrated human practices section, to address the biocontainment and efficiency of either platform. This is addressed in Iteration Loop 2.

Furthermore, they advised using an existing HVT vaccine as a foundation for a comparative Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). This allows us to benchmark our novel technology against an approved, related product.
