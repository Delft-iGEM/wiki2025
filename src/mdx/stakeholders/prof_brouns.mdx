# Prof. Dr. Stan J. J. Brouns

## Who?
Prof. Dr. Stan Brouns is an expert in phage–host interactions and bacterial defence systems.

## Why?
We wanted to explore which phages and bacterial hosts would be most practical for our oral vaccine. Moreover, we discussed the feasibility of our experiments.

## Impact on Snaccine
Prof. Brouns discussed the options for bacterial hosts and phages with us. He highlighted the importance of tailoring our host to the gut, and working with well-established display systems. With his input, we could move from an initial idea to more concrete plans. We settled on the well-established bacterial host E. Coli, and the display phages T7 and MS2. He also connected us with his colleague, Rita Martins Costa, who became an ongoing technical mentor for our experimental work. This first stakeholder meeting ensured that our design ideas could be translated into feasible plans.
