# Dr. Charlotte Koster

## Who?
Dr. Charlotte Koster is a post-doctoral researcher at Wageningen University and a science communicator. Her expertise lies in molecular microbiology and in translating scientific concepts into clear information for a diverse audience.

## Why?
We sought her advice on how to present Snaccine to different audiences and how to balance technical accuracy with accessibility.

## Impact on Snaccine
She recommended presenting Snaccine through a clear storytelling arc. We also segmented our audience into three key groups: the scientific community, the undecided public, and vaccine-hesitant groups. Based on that, we set the goal to bridge the communication gap between the undecided public, and scientific information.

Charlotte also recommended a two-way communication approach. We explained Snaccine to 12 members of the general public, and listened to their questions and concerns. These questions are answered in our Iteration Loop 6. Moreover, we committed to transparent communication, acknowledging both benefits and uncertainties.
