# Avian Influenza Field Test Experts

## Who?
Two European experts in HPAI vaccination field trials and surveillance.

## Why?
We wanted to gain insight into the real-world challenges of HPAI vaccination. We were also interested to learn about their interactions with farmer during the field trials.

## Impact on Snaccine
The insights from this meeting directly influenced our project's strategy. Based on their feedback, we designed our mRNA to express only the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which aligns with existing ELISA and PCR surveillance methods. This allows Snaccine to fit into DIVA diagnostics.

We also learned that farmers are generally open to HPAI vaccination to prevent the culling of their flocks. However, their main concern is the marketing of vaccinated animal products, which hinders participation in field trials. This feedback made us aware of the economic constraints for successful implementation.
