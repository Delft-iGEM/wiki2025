**Introduction**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/chicken-modules-overview.webp)

The following  results  showcase the first  experimental  outcomes from the Snaccine platform, organized  around  key proof-of-concept  milestones. Each module of our  workflow  addresses a distinct challenge - ranging from phage  genome engineering and stability  testing to VLP expression, delivery, and immunogenicity - but together  they  converge on the central goal of creating a flexible and accessible RNA vaccine design system. In this  section, we highlight  representative  findings  that  validate  critical  steps of the platform, including  successful  expression and assembly of MS2 virus-like  particles in E. coli and the establishment of a novel in vitro phage engineering pipeline. These  results  provide  both  technical  validation of our  approach and a foundation for the later  modules  that  extend  toward  functional  delivery and immune  testing.

While  optimizing  methods to engineer  bacteriophages (Module A), we also  focused on testing  our  synthetic DNA construct in a plasmid form before  advancing to phage engineering.  This  strategy  allowed  us to verify  that  our **DNA design functions as intended  before  integrating  it  into the more  complex  phage system**. The plasmid was designed to partially  **mimic the effect  that  our  modified  phages**  would  have in the final  vaccine by **driving the production of MS2 virus-like  particles (VLPs) in E. coli**. If  our  construct was designed  correctly, the bacteria  should  produce MS2 VLPs  that  are  correctly  folded and do not aggregate.

Our engineering journey in Module C was guided by the iterative **Design–Build–Test–Learn**  cycle, where  each  experimental run informed the next. Rather  than  being a linear  process, the development of our MS2 VLP expression system unfolded in multiple  rounds of design refinement, troubleshooting, and protocol  adjustment.

## **Design**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-1.webp)
We began by designing a synthetic plasmid (pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp) containing a T7/lac promoter, the MS2 maturase gene, the coat protein gene, and an MS2 RNA stem loop (*Figure 1*) .

This construct represented the foundation of our vaccine platform. Alongside the plasmid design, we prepared a detailed workflow for expression and validation, including IPTG induction in E. coli BL21(DE3), cell lysis, SDS-PAGE analysis, PEG precipitation, and TEM imaging. Before moving into experiments, we presented this design to an external protein expression expert, whose advice proved crucial: they emphasized the importance of long, low-temperature inductions to favor solubility and suggested sequencing plasmid DNA from early cultures to confirm construct integrity.

Based on this feedback, we refined our expression plan to use 0.4 mM IPTG at 17 °C for 16 hours, and we added a plasmid isolation and sequencing checkpoint to ensure that mutations or cloning errors would not confound downstream experiments.

## Build and Test

With these refinements, we expressed the construct for the first time and analyzed the lysates by SDS-PAGE. At this stage, our lysis protocol combined enzymatic digestion with lysozyme and mechanical disruption by sonication. The gel, however, produced confusing results: a strong band appeared at ~14  kDa across all lanes, including the negative control (*Figure 2*).

***Figure 2.** SDS-PAGE analysis of initial MS2 expression showing a strong ~14 kDa band in all samples, including the negative control. The band likely corresponds to lysozyme from the lysis buffer, overlapping with the expected size of the MS2 coat protein.*

After some troubleshooting, we discovered the problem - lysozyme itself has a [molecular weight](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/89833?ef_id=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!10!77378333109598!!!!2329177945372041!!471275954!1238051176326156&cid=bid_sap_prp_r01_co_cp1362_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_bng_dy_pur_con&msclkid=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69) (14.3 kDa) that overlapped with the expected signal from MS2 proteins (13.7kDa). In effect, the lysis enzyme was masking our target. This realization was a turning point: we adjusted the protocol to exclude lysozyme and rely solely on sonication for cell disruption, ensuring that no extraneous proteins would interfere with analysis.

## Learn and Iterate

Repeating the experiment with this improved protocol gave a clear outcome. After Bradford normalization to equalize protein content across samples, SDS-PAGE revealed a distinct band at 13.7 kDa  - the expected size of the MS2 coat protein. Importantly, this band appeared only in the induced supernatant fraction, not in the uninduced controls or pellet fractions. This result confirmed that our construct was functional and that the protein was expressed in a soluble, folded form rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies.

With soluble expression established, we advanced to the next stage: concentrating, purifying,  and validating the VLP assemblies. Using PEG precipitation, we concentrated the soluble proteins into a visible pellet, selectively enriching for assembled capsids while leaving background proteins in solution. This pellet was resuspended and analyzed by TEM. The negative-stain micrographs revealed discrete spherical particles approximately 27 nm in diameter, consistent with the expected morphology of MS2 VLPs. This provided strong evidence that our engineered coat proteins not only expressed but also self-assembled into virus-like particles.

## Future development

Encouraged by this  success, we began  designing the next  iteration of the system to demonstrate  modularity. In this version, we planned to encapsulate a “dummy  vaccine RNA” containing a eukaryotic  expression  machinery  inside the MS2 particles.

*Figure 3. Plasmid design for the next-generation MS2 system encoding a “dummy vaccine RNA” and optimized coat proteins for RNA packaging and delivery.*

The goal of this  new design (*Figure 3*) is to express and purify the VLPs with the same validated  workflow and then expose them to eukaryotic  cells. If  successful, the uptake of VLPs and expression of the model protein would  confirm the end-to-end functionality of our platform: packaging, delivery, and expression.

Through this iterative process, each experiment guided the next step. Troubleshooting issues like the lysozyme interference, validating expression with sequencing checkpoints, and confirming assembly with PEG precipitation and TEM all strengthened our confidence in the system. By moving through successive rounds of design, testing, and refinement, we established a robust method for producing functional MS2 VLPs in E. coli and laid the groundwork for future iterations carrying custom vaccine payloads.

A key goal of Snaccine is to develop an **accessible and modular phage engineering pipeline**. Current phage modification tools are often laborious or limited to specific genome loci. To overcome these constraints, we implemented a novel *in vitro* engineering method based on **PCR amplification and genome assembly**, inspired by the work of Levrier *et al.* and Vu *et al.*. This method provides high efficiency while relying primarily on standard molecular biology techniques.

### proof-of-concept: engineering an insertion

#### PCR of T7 Phage Fragments

The first step involved PCR amplification of **T7 phage genome fragments**, preparing both a **wild-type genome** and a variant with an **mCherry gene insertion** downstream of gene 10 (within fragment C, subdivided into C1 and C2). The wild-type genome served as a control to validate the assembly process independently of inserted sequences.

To ensure site-specific insertion, we incorporated **50 bp homology arms** into the PCR primers. For the mCherry insertion, primers also introduced **orthogonal homologous sequences (oho)** to minimize unintended recombination with the T7 genome. This design enables selection for correct assembly, as no viable genome can form without successful integration of exogenous DNA.

**Figure 3.**  
*Upper panel:* Diagram of (a) wild-type T7 genome fragments and (b) T7 genome with mCherry insertion.  
*Lower panel:* Agarose gel confirmation of PCR amplification for T7 genome fragments (A, B, C, D, C1, C2) and mCherry gene. Lane 1: NEB 1 kb+ ladder.

Following the approach of Levrier *et al.*, the T7 genome was divided into four main fragments (A–D). For the wild-type genome, primer sequences were based on established designs, while primers for mCherry, C1, and C2 fragments were modified to include *oho1* and *oho2* sequences. All fragments were amplified using **Q5 polymerase**.

As the template, we used intact T7 phages rather than isolated DNA, extending the initial denaturation step to 5 minutes to release genomic DNA. Successful amplification was confirmed by **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**.

### genome assembly and screening

PCR fragments were column-purified, quantified, and combined at equimolar concentrations in a **commercial genome assembly mix**. Assembly success was screened by PCR targeting junction regions between fragments. Product size varied depending on the region amplified.

**Figure 4.**  
*AGE visualization of assembled genome fragments.*  
Most fragments assembled successfully, though some junctions—particularly between A/B and C1/mCherry—did not yield products, suggesting incomplete assembly at those sites.

### transformation and infection

Despite incomplete assembly, we proceeded with **transformation** to test whether *E. coli* cellular machinery could complete assembly *in vivo*. Following Levrier *et al.*, even partially assembled genomes can be repaired post-transformation via homologous recombination.

A modified **BL21 heat-shock transformation** was performed using standard NEB guidelines. After outgrowth, samples were incubated in LB with additional *E. coli* to support phage propagation. No antibiotics were added due to the lack of resistance markers. The following day, supernatants were centrifuged, filtered, and analyzed via **plaque assay**.

**Figure 5.**  
*Plaque assay results for control and experimental samples.*

While the T7 control showed positive plaque formation, no plaques were observed in the engineered samples, suggesting unsuccessful reboot. To improve efficiency, we next attempted **electroporation**, which enables uptake of larger DNA fragments. However, this also did not yield conclusive results, indicating the need for further optimization.

## summary

In this phase, we established two major components of the Snaccine workflow:

1. **MS2 VLP Module:** Demonstrated successful bacterial expression, solubility, and self-assembly of MS2 VLPs.  
2. **Phage Engineering Module:** Developed and tested a modular *in vitro* T7 phage engineering pipeline, showing promise but requiring optimization for full genome assembly and reboot efficiency.

Together, these results validate key steps toward building an accessible RNA vaccine design system integrating phage engineering, VLP production, and RNA delivery.
