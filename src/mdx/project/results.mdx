# Introduction

The following results present the first experimental outcomes from the **Snaccine** platform, organized around key proof-of-concept milestones. Each module of the workflow addresses a distinct challenge—ranging from phage genome engineering and stability testing to virus-like particle (VLP) expression, delivery, and immunogenicity—but together they converge on the central goal of creating a flexible and accessible RNA vaccine design system.

In this section, we highlight representative findings that validate critical steps of the platform, including successful expression and assembly of MS2 VLPs in *E. coli* and the establishment of a novel *in vitro* phage engineering pipeline. These results provide both technical validation of our approach and a foundation for later modules focused on functional delivery and immune testing.

<Dropdown header="MS2 Capsid Expression in E. coli" level={0}>

As a first step, we tested a synthetic DNA construct encoding the **MS2 coat protein** under an inducible promoter. This plasmid served as an intermediate stage before transitioning to phage engineering, allowing us to confirm the functionality of our DNA design in a simpler system. The construct was designed to mimic the intended phage modification by driving production of MS2 VLPs in *E. coli*.

Transformed *E. coli* cells were induced for protein expression, and VLP production was verified via **SDS–PAGE** (to confirm coat protein expression) and **TEM** (to visualize assembled particles). The bacteria successfully synthesized MS2 coat protein subunits, which folded correctly and assembled into uniform, non-aggregated VLPs. This marks a major milestone for the Snaccine platform, demonstrating successful VLP production in a bacterial system.



### SDS–PAGE Analysis of MS2 Expression

To confirm expression of the MS2 coat protein following transformation, we performed SDS–PAGE analysis. This method denatures proteins and separates them by molecular weight, enabling detection of the coat protein at its expected size of **13.7 kDa**. While this technique does not confirm correct folding or assembly, it provides direct evidence of expression.

A clear band at ~13.7 kDa confirms expression of the MS2 coat protein.

The SDS–PAGE results clearly demonstrate successful induction of the MS2 coat protein. A strong band at ~14 kDa appears in the induced supernatant (lane 1), absent in the uninduced control (lane 2), confirming IPTG-dependent expression. The localization of the protein in the supernatant suggests that most of it remains soluble rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies—an encouraging result indicating proper folding.

In the induced pellet fraction (lane 3), faint bands appear across a range of molecular weights, consistent with cell debris and aggregated proteins, with only a small proportion of coat protein detected. The uninduced pellet (lane 4) lacks any band at ~14 kDa, confirming the absence of expression without induction.

The comparison between induced and uninduced samples confirms that IPTG induction successfully triggers coat protein synthesis. The high intensity of the induced band suggests robust expression levels, though background host proteins are also visible.

A faint band in the induced pellet fraction (~14 kDa) may indicate a small portion of insoluble MS2 protein, potentially from aggregated or incompletely released VLPs. Optimization of expression parameters—such as IPTG concentration, induction time, and temperature—could clarify this point. Additionally, refining lysis protocols (e.g., enzymatic lysis or optimized sonication) could help differentiate between incomplete lysis and genuine aggregation. While lysozyme was avoided due to its similar molecular weight, combining it with complementary detection methods such as Western blotting could yield additional insight.

### TEM Imaging of MS2 VLPs

Having confirmed expression via SDS–PAGE, we next performed **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** to visualize VLP assembly. TEM imaging of the purified induced fraction revealed numerous uniform spherical particles with diameters of **25–30 nm**, consistent with the expected size of MS2 VLPs. Image averaging revealed the characteristic **icosahedral symmetry** of MS2 capsids, confirming correct assembly rather than random aggregation.

These results provide critical structural validation: the MS2 coat proteins not only expressed and remained soluble but also self-assembled into complete, correctly folded VLPs. Together, the SDS–PAGE and TEM results confirm functional expression and structural integrity of recombinant MS2 particles.

### Future Outlook

We have successfully demonstrated bacterial production of properly folded MS2 VLPs incorporating a small RNA stem–loop to trigger assembly. The next step will involve engineering a plasmid containing **functional RNA cargo**—for example, an mRNA sequence encoding GFP or a therapeutic target such as an H5N1 vaccine insert. These constructs will test whether MS2 VLPs can efficiently **package, protect, and transport RNA** molecules, and whether encapsulated RNA affects capsid folding or stability. Systematic exploration of these factors will determine the suitability of recombinant MS2 VLPs as customizable RNA delivery platforms.

A key goal of Snaccine is to develop an **accessible and modular phage engineering pipeline**. Current phage modification tools are often laborious or limited to specific genome loci. To overcome these constraints, we implemented a novel *in vitro* engineering method based on **PCR amplification and genome assembly**, inspired by the work of Levrier *et al.* and Vu *et al.*. This method provides high efficiency while relying primarily on standard molecular biology techniques.

### Proof-of-Concept: Engineering an Insertion

#### PCR of T7 Phage Fragments

The first step involved PCR amplification of **T7 phage genome fragments**, preparing both a **wild-type genome** and a variant with an **mCherry gene insertion** downstream of gene 10 (within fragment C, subdivided into C1 and C2). The wild-type genome served as a control to validate the assembly process independently of inserted sequences.

To ensure site-specific insertion, we incorporated **50 bp homology arms** into the PCR primers. For the mCherry insertion, primers also introduced **orthogonal homologous sequences (oho)** to minimize unintended recombination with the T7 genome. This design enables selection for correct assembly, as no viable genome can form without successful integration of exogenous DNA.

Following the approach of Levrier *et al.*, the T7 genome was divided into four main fragments (A–D). For the wild-type genome, primer sequences were based on established designs, while primers for mCherry, C1, and C2 fragments were modified to include *oho1* and *oho2* sequences. All fragments were amplified using **Q5 polymerase**.

As the template, we used intact T7 phages rather than isolated DNA, extending the initial denaturation step to 5 minutes to release genomic DNA. Successful amplification was confirmed by **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**.

### Genome Assembly and Screening

PCR fragments were column-purified, quantified, and combined at equimolar concentrations in a **commercial genome assembly mix**. Assembly success was screened by PCR targeting junction regions between fragments. Product size varied depending on the region amplified.

**Figure 4.**  
*AGE visualization of assembled genome fragments.*  
Most fragments assembled successfully, though some junctions—particularly between A/B and C1/mCherry—did not yield products, suggesting incomplete assembly at those sites.

### Transformation and Infection

Despite incomplete assembly, we proceeded with **transformation** to test whether *E. coli* cellular machinery could complete assembly *in vivo*. Following Levrier *et al.*, even partially assembled genomes can be repaired post-transformation via homologous recombination.

A modified **BL21 heat-shock transformation** was performed using standard NEB guidelines. After outgrowth, samples were incubated in LB with additional *E. coli* to support phage propagation. No antibiotics were added due to the lack of resistance markers. The following day, supernatants were centrifuged, filtered, and analyzed via **plaque assay**.

**Figure 5.**  
*Plaque assay results for control and experimental samples.*

While the T7 control showed positive plaque formation, no plaques were observed in the engineered samples, suggesting unsuccessful reboot. To improve efficiency, we next attempted **electroporation**, which enables uptake of larger DNA fragments. However, this also did not yield conclusive results, indicating the need for further optimization.

## Summary

In this phase, we established two major components of the Snaccine workflow:

1. **MS2 VLP Module:** Demonstrated successful bacterial expression, solubility, and self-assembly of MS2 VLPs.  
2. **Phage Engineering Module:** Developed and tested a modular *in vitro* T7 phage engineering pipeline, showing promise but requiring optimization for full genome assembly and reboot efficiency.

Together, these results validate key steps toward building an accessible RNA vaccine design system integrating phage engineering, VLP production, and RNA delivery.
