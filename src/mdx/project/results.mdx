**Introduction**

The following  results  showcase the first  experimental  outcomes from the Snaccine platform, organized  around  key proof-of-concept  milestones. Each module of our  workflow  addresses a distinct challenge - ranging from phage  genome engineering and stability  testing to VLP expression, delivery, and immunogenicity - but together  they  converge on the central goal of creating a flexible and accessible RNA vaccine design system. In this  section, we highlight  representative  findings  that  validate  critical  steps of the platform, including  successful  expression and assembly of MS2 virus-like  particles in E. coli and the establishment of a novel in vitro phage engineering pipeline. These  results  provide  both  technical  validation of our  approach and a foundation for the later  modules  that  extend  toward  functional  delivery and immune  testing.

For our first step, we focused on testing our synthetic DNA construct- encoding the MS2 coat protein under an inducible promoter - in plasmid form as an intermediate stage before moving to phage engineering. This strategy allowed us to verify that our DNA design functioned as intended before integrating it into the more complex phage system. The plasmid was designed to partially mimic the effect that our modified phages would have in the final vaccine by driving the production of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) in E. coli.

We transformed E. coli with the plasmid, induced protein expression, and confirmed VLP production using SDS–PAGE to detect coat-protein expression and TEM to visualize intact assembled particles. These experiments showed that the bacteria successfully synthesized the MS2 coat protein subunits, which then folded correctly and assembled into complete, non-aggregated VLPs. This successful outcome marks a major step forward for our project and highlights the potential of our vaccine platform.

**SDS-PAGE Analysis of MS2 Expression**

First, we wanted to confirm whether our construct successfully led to protein expression in E. coli after transformation. To do this, we performed an SDS-PAGE gel, which denatures all proteins in the sample and separates them based on molecular weight. This method allows us to detect whether the MS2 coat protein is being produced at the expected molecular weight of 13.7 kDa, but it does not provide information on whether the protein is folded correctly or assembled into higher-order structures.

The SDS-PAGE results provide clear evidence of successful expression of the MS2 coat protein. Based on the molecular weight ladder, the MS2 protein is expected to migrate at approximately 14 kDa. A distinct band at this molecular weight is visible in the induced supernatant sample (lane 1), while the same band is absent in the uninduced supernatant (lane 2). This strongly indicates that IPTG induction triggered expression of the MS2 protein.

The localization of the protein in the supernatant fraction suggests that the majority of the expressed MS2 protein remains soluble rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies. This is a favorable outcome, as solubility implies that the protein is likely folded correctly, which is essential for its role in RNA encapsulation and transport. In the induced pellet fraction (lane 3), faint protein bands are visible across a range of molecular weights, consistent with cellular debris and aggregated proteins. Importantly, only a minor fraction of the MS2 coat protein is observed here, further supporting that most of the protein remains in the soluble fraction. The uninduced pellet (lane 4) shows no band at ~14 kDa, confirming the absence of MS2 expression in uninduced conditions.

The comparison between induced and uninduced samples highlights successful recombinant expression. The induced supernatant (lane 1) clearly shows the ~14 kDa band absent from uninduced controls, ruling out the possibility that it corresponds to an endogenous E. coli protein. The relatively strong intensity of the induced supernatant band also suggests robust expression levels, although additional faint bands in all samples represent background host proteins.

Interestingly, a very faint band is also observed in the induced pellet fraction at ~14 kDa. This could indicate that a small proportion of MS2 protein is present in the insoluble fraction, possibly as virus-like particles (VLPs) that either aggregated or remained trapped in cells that were not fully lysed. In addition, a prominent band around ~43.2 kDa is visible in the induced pellet fraction, corresponding to the Maturase protein, which is expected to be present under these expression conditions. Future optimization could help clarify this point. Adjusting IPTG concentrations, induction times, and incubation temperatures may influence expression levels and folding efficiency, thereby altering the balance between soluble and insoluble protein. Comparing the relative abundance of the 14 kDa protein across fractions under different conditions would provide useful insights into solubility and aggregation tendencies.

**TEM Imaging of MS2 Capsids**

The SDS-PAGE results provided strong evidence that the MS2 coat protein was successfully expressed upon IPTG induction, qualifying the sample for further structural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Examination of the purified induced fraction revealed numerous uniform particles with diameters of approximately 25–30 nm, consistent with the expected size range of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). To further validate these observations, TEM image averaging was performed, which revealed an icosahedral,  structure characteristic of MS2 capsids. This additional analysis confirmed that the observed particles were indeed MS2 VLPs and not unrelated protein aggregates present in the bacterial lysate.

The TEM results, therefore  provide  critical  structural  validation, showing  that the coat  proteins  were not only  expressed and soluble but also  capable of self-assembling  into  complete  VLPs. Taken  together, SDS-PAGE confirmed  successful  expression of soluble  coat protein, while TEM demonstrated  that  these  proteins  formed  correctly  folded  capsid  complexes with the expected  icosahedral  symmetry.

**Future  outlook**

Looking forward, we have successfully produced properly folded MS2 VLPs in bacteria by incorporating a small RNA stem–loop to trigger assembly. The next logical step will be to engineer a plasmid that includes functional RNA cargo. 
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/ms2-vlp-with-rna-schematic.webp)
This could involve inserting an mRNA sequence encoding a model “dummy protein” such as GFP, or ultimately a relevant therapeutic sequence like an H5N1 mRNA vaccine insert. 
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/moduledplasmidbiorender/module-d-plasmid-biorender.webp)
Such constructs would allow us to test whether MS2 VLPs can efficiently package, protect, and transport RNA molecules. Furthermore, these experiments would reveal whether RNA encapsulation affects the proper folding and stability of the VLP capsids. By systematically exploring these aspects, we can establish whether recombinant MS2 VLPs are suitable for use as customizable RNA delivery platforms.

A key goal of Snaccine is to develop an **accessible and modular phage engineering pipeline**. Current phage modification tools are often laborious or limited to specific genome loci. To overcome these constraints, we implemented a novel *in vitro* engineering method based on **PCR amplification and genome assembly**, inspired by the work of Levrier *et al.* and Vu *et al.*. This method provides high efficiency while relying primarily on standard molecular biology techniques.

### proof-of-concept: engineering an insertion

#### PCR of T7 Phage Fragments

The first step involved PCR amplification of **T7 phage genome fragments**, preparing both a **wild-type genome** and a variant with an **mCherry gene insertion** downstream of gene 10 (within fragment C, subdivided into C1 and C2). The wild-type genome served as a control to validate the assembly process independently of inserted sequences.

To ensure site-specific insertion, we incorporated **50 bp homology arms** into the PCR primers. For the mCherry insertion, primers also introduced **orthogonal homologous sequences (oho)** to minimize unintended recombination with the T7 genome. This design enables selection for correct assembly, as no viable genome can form without successful integration of exogenous DNA.

Following the approach of Levrier *et al.*, the T7 genome was divided into four main fragments (A–D). For the wild-type genome, primer sequences were based on established designs, while primers for mCherry, C1, and C2 fragments were modified to include *oho1* and *oho2* sequences. All fragments were amplified using **Q5 polymerase**.

As the template, we used intact T7 phages rather than isolated DNA, extending the initial denaturation step to 5 minutes to release genomic DNA. Successful amplification was confirmed by **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**.

### genome assembly and screening

PCR fragments were column-purified, quantified, and combined at equimolar concentrations in a **commercial genome assembly mix**. Assembly success was screened by PCR targeting junction regions between fragments. Product size varied depending on the region amplified.

**Figure 4.**  
*AGE visualization of assembled genome fragments.*  
Most fragments assembled successfully, though some junctions—particularly between A/B and C1/mCherry—did not yield products, suggesting incomplete assembly at those sites.

### transformation and infection

Despite incomplete assembly, we proceeded with **transformation** to test whether *E. coli* cellular machinery could complete assembly *in vivo*. Following Levrier *et al.*, even partially assembled genomes can be repaired post-transformation via homologous recombination.

A modified **BL21 heat-shock transformation** was performed using standard NEB guidelines. After outgrowth, samples were incubated in LB with additional *E. coli* to support phage propagation. No antibiotics were added due to the lack of resistance markers. The following day, supernatants were centrifuged, filtered, and analyzed via **plaque assay**.

**Figure 5.**  
*Plaque assay results for control and experimental samples.*

While the T7 control showed positive plaque formation, no plaques were observed in the engineered samples, suggesting unsuccessful reboot. To improve efficiency, we next attempted **electroporation**, which enables uptake of larger DNA fragments. However, this also did not yield conclusive results, indicating the need for further optimization.

## summary

In this phase, we established two major components of the Snaccine workflow:

1. **MS2 VLP Module:** Demonstrated successful bacterial expression, solubility, and self-assembly of MS2 VLPs.  
2. **Phage Engineering Module:** Developed and tested a modular *in vitro* T7 phage engineering pipeline, showing promise but requiring optimization for full genome assembly and reboot efficiency.

Together, these results validate key steps toward building an accessible RNA vaccine design system integrating phage engineering, VLP production, and RNA delivery.
