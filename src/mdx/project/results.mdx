**Introduction**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/chicken-modules-overview.webp)

The following  results  showcase the first  experimental  outcomes from the Snaccine platform, organized  around  key proof-of-concept  milestones. Each module of our  workflow  addresses a distinct challenge - ranging from phage  genome engineering and stability  testing to VLP expression, delivery, and immunogenicity - but together  they  converge on the central goal of creating a flexible and accessible RNA vaccine design system. In this  section, we highlight  representative  findings  that  validate  critical  steps of the platform, including  successful  expression and assembly of MS2 virus-like  particles in E. coli and the establishment of a novel in vitro phage engineering pipeline. These  results  provide  both  technical  validation of our  approach and a foundation for the later  modules  that  extend  toward  functional  delivery and immune  testing.

**MS2 VLP Expression in E.coli**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/module-c-plasmid-schematic.webp)
For our first step, we focused on testing our synthetic DNA construct- encoding the MS2 coat protein under an inducible promoter - in plasmid form as an intermediate stage before moving to phage engineering. This strategy allowed us to verify that our DNA design functioned as intended before integrating it into the more complex phage system. The plasmid was designed to partially mimic the effect that our modified phages would have in the final vaccine by driving the production of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) in E. coli.
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/vlp-complex-and-assembly.webp)
We transformed E. coli with the plasmid, induced protein expression, and confirmed VLP production using SDS–PAGE to detect coat-protein expression and TEM to visualize intact assembled particles. These experiments showed that the bacteria successfully synthesized the MS2 coat protein subunits, which then folded correctly and assembled into complete, non-aggregated VLPs. This successful outcome marks a major step forward for our project and highlights the potential of our vaccine platform.

**SDS-PAGE Analysis of MS2 Expression**

First, we wanted to confirm whether our construct successfully led to protein expression in E. coli after transformation. To do this, we performed an SDS-PAGE gel, which denatures all proteins in the sample and separates them based on molecular weight. This method allows us to detect whether the MS2 coat protein is being produced at the expected molecular weight of 13.7 kDa, but it does not provide information on whether the protein is folded correctly or assembled into higher-order structures.

The SDS-PAGE results provide clear evidence of successful expression of the MS2 coat protein. Based on the molecular weight ladder, the MS2 protein is expected to migrate at approximately 14 kDa. A distinct band at this molecular weight is visible in the induced supernatant sample (lane 1), while the same band is absent in the uninduced supernatant (lane 2). This strongly indicates that IPTG induction triggered expression of the MS2 protein.

The localization of the protein in the supernatant fraction suggests that the majority of the expressed MS2 protein remains soluble rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies. This is a favorable outcome, as solubility implies that the protein is likely folded correctly, which is essential for its role in RNA encapsulation and transport. In the induced pellet fraction (lane 3), faint protein bands are visible across a range of molecular weights, consistent with cellular debris and aggregated proteins. Importantly, only a minor fraction of the MS2 coat protein is observed here, further supporting that most of the protein remains in the soluble fraction. The uninduced pellet (lane 4) shows no band at ~14 kDa, confirming the absence of MS2 expression in uninduced conditions.

The comparison between induced and uninduced samples highlights successful recombinant expression. The induced supernatant (lane 1) clearly shows the ~14 kDa band absent from uninduced controls, ruling out the possibility that it corresponds to an endogenous E. coli protein. The relatively strong intensity of the induced supernatant band also suggests robust expression levels, although additional faint bands in all samples represent background host proteins.

Interestingly, a very faint band is also observed in the induced pellet fraction at ~14 kDa. This could indicate that a small proportion of MS2 protein is present in the insoluble fraction, possibly as virus-like particles (VLPs) that either aggregated or remained trapped in cells that were not fully lysed. In addition, a prominent band around ~43.2 kDa is visible in the induced pellet fraction, corresponding to the Maturase protein, which is expected to be present under these expression conditions. Future optimization could help clarify this point. Adjusting IPTG concentrations, induction times, and incubation temperatures may influence expression levels and folding efficiency, thereby altering the balance between soluble and insoluble protein. Comparing the relative abundance of the 14 kDa protein across fractions under different conditions would provide useful insights into solubility and aggregation tendencies.

**TEM Imaging of MS2 Capsids**
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/tem-image-rectangle.webp)
The SDS-PAGE results provided strong evidence that the MS2 coat protein was successfully expressed upon IPTG induction, qualifying the sample for further structural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Examination of the purified induced fraction revealed numerous uniform particles with diameters of approximately 25–30 nm, consistent with the expected size range of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). To further validate these observations, TEM image averaging was performed, which revealed an icosahedral,  structure characteristic of MS2 capsids. This additional analysis confirmed that the observed particles were indeed MS2 VLPs and not unrelated protein aggregates present in the bacterial lysate.
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/tem-image-with-class-average-beside.webp)
The TEM results, therefore  provide  critical  structural  validation, showing  that the coat  proteins  were not only  expressed and soluble but also  capable of self-assembling  into  complete  VLPs. Taken  together, SDS-PAGE confirmed  successful  expression of soluble  coat protein, while TEM demonstrated  that  these  proteins  formed  correctly  folded  capsid  complexes with the expected  icosahedral  symmetry.

**Future  outlook**

Looking forward, we have successfully produced properly folded MS2 VLPs in bacteria by incorporating a small RNA stem–loop to trigger assembly. The next logical step will be to engineer a plasmid that includes functional RNA cargo. 
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/ms2-vlp-with-rna-schematic.webp)
This could involve inserting an mRNA sequence encoding a model “dummy protein” such as GFP, or ultimately a relevant therapeutic sequence like an H5N1 mRNA vaccine insert. 
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/moduledplasmidbiorender/module-d-plasmid-biorender.webp)
Such constructs would allow us to test whether MS2 VLPs can efficiently package, protect, and transport RNA molecules. Furthermore, these experiments would reveal whether RNA encapsulation affects the proper folding and stability of the VLP capsids. By systematically exploring these aspects, we can establish whether recombinant MS2 VLPs are suitable for use as customizable RNA delivery platforms.

### Proof-of-Concept: Engineering an Insertion

#### PCR of T7 Phage Fragments

To establish a proof-of-concept for our T7 phage engineering strategy, we aimed to insert an **mCherry gene downstream of gene 10**, a region known for high expression levels. This site was chosen based on literature and expert advice, as it allows for efficient expression while maintaining phage viability. As a control, we also amplified the **wild-type (WT)** T7 genome without any insertions.

We began by amplifying **T7 genome fragments (A–D)** using **Q5 polymerase**, alongside a variant in which fragment C was subdivided into **C1 and C2** to allow for the insertion of the **mCherry** gene. To enable site-specific insertion, all primers contained **50 bp homology arms**, and for the mCherry construct, we incorporated **orthogonal homologous sequences (oho1/oho2)**. These orthogonal regions minimized unwanted recombination with the native T7 genome and ensured that only correctly assembled genomes would produce viable phages.

Instead of purifying phage DNA beforehand, we followed the approach of Levrier *et al.*, using **intact T7 phages** as a PCR template with an extended 5-minute initial denaturation step to release genomic DNA. All fragments amplified successfully and were visualized on **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**, confirming that our PCR design worked efficiently despite the long primers required for the orthogonal arms.

### Genome Assembly and Screening

Next, we combined the PCR-amplified fragments in a **commercial DNA assembly mix** to reconstruct the complete phage genome *in vitro*. Each fragment was first purified and quantified to ensure equimolar ratios during assembly. To evaluate the assembly’s success, we performed **junction-specific PCRs** targeting overlapping regions between neighboring fragments (e.g., A–B, B–C, C–D). The expected product sizes differed depending on which junction was tested.

> *AGE visualization of assembled genome fragments.*  
> Most junctions produced products of the expected sizes, confirming partial assembly of the genome. However, certain junctions—particularly **A/B** and **C1/mCherry**—did not yield PCR products, suggesting that the assembly at those sites remained incomplete.

While full-length genome assembly was not achieved in this attempt, the strong amplification of other junctions demonstrated that the technique was functional and that fragment annealing occurred for a significant portion of the genome. This partial success validated the overall **compatibility of the T7 fragments and insert design**, and highlighted specific points for optimization—especially around long repetitive regions and fragments with orthogonal overlaps.

### Transformation and Infection

Following the **Design–Build–Test–Learn** cycle, we decided to test whether *E. coli* could naturally complete the assembly of partially joined fragments *in vivo*. Literature suggested that even incomplete genomes can undergo recombination after transformation, restoring viable phages under the right conditions (Levrier *et al.*).

We first performed a **modified BL21 heat-shock transformation**, introducing the assembled genome directly into competent *E. coli* cells without any antibiotic selection, as our constructs contained no resistance markers. The cells were allowed to recover in rich LB medium and incubated overnight with additional *E. coli* to promote phage propagation. The following day, cultures were centrifuged, filtered, and analyzed using a **plaque assay** to detect the presence of viable phages.

> **Figure 5.**  
> *Plaque assay results for control and experimental samples.*  
> Clear plaques were observed only in the **wild-type control**, confirming the assay’s functionality. In contrast, no plaques appeared for the mCherry-engineered samples, indicating that **no viable recombinant phages were produced** during this round.

Given the potential size and complexity of the assembled DNA (~40 kb), we suspected that standard transformation might have limited efficiency. To improve uptake, we repeated the experiment using **electroporation**, a technique capable of introducing large DNA molecules into cells more effectively. Despite this improvement, plaque assays again showed no visible plaques, suggesting that additional optimization is required—possibly in the assembly or transformation stages.

### Reflection and Outlook

Although we did not yet obtain functional engineered phages, this proof-of-concept experiment validated several essential steps of our engineering framework:

- **PCR amplification of large genomic fragments** from intact T7 phages was achieved successfully using our extended-denaturation protocol.  
- **DNA assembly reactions** produced multiple correctly joined junctions, showing that the design of our homology regions was viable.  
- **Screening methods** effectively distinguished between successful and incomplete assemblies, providing a clear foundation for iterative troubleshooting.  

The lack of plaques indicates that further refinement is needed in either the assembly efficiency or the transformation step. Future experiments will focus on:

1. **Optimizing homology arm length and overlap composition** to improve full-genome assembly yield.  
2. **Testing DNA concentration effects** during the assembly mix, as literature (e.g., Vu *et al.*) suggests that higher DNA input may not always correlate with improved results.  
3. **Implementing electroporation protocols optimized for large DNA fragments**, potentially coupled with recombination-proficient *E. coli* strains.  

Despite not yielding viable phages yet, this module **established a solid experimental framework** for *in vitro* T7 phage genome engineering. With the considerations that multiple studies such as Levrier et al and Vu et al have already confirmed this phage engineering method to work in their context, suggests that with further troubleshooting and iterative refinement of the procedure, a phage engineering pipeline can be achieved which would allow the rapid engineering of phages.
