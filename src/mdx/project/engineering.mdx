# introduction

The Engineering section describes how we applied the iGEM Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) cycle across all modules of the Snaccine platform. Each module represents a specific stage in developing an accessible and modular RNA vaccine system—from phage genome engineering and stability testing to virus-like particle (VLP) production, delivery, and immunogenicity.

By dividing the project into parallel yet interconnected modules, we were able to iterate rapidly, troubleshoot effectively, and leverage progress in one area to accelerate development in others. This section outlines the rationale behind our design choices, the technical challenges encountered, and the engineering strategies that guided us toward our overarching goal: building a flexible RNA vaccine platform capable of adapting to fast-evolving viral threats such as avian influenza.

<Dropdown header="phage genome engineering" level={0}>

### overview
This module focused on establishing a rapid and flexible bacteriophage genome engineering workflow as the foundation of the Snaccine vaccine platform. Our goal was to design phages capable of colonizing the gut microbiome and driving in situ production of antigen mRNA encapsulated within MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). By leveraging the natural biology of bacteriophages, we sought to develop a vaccine strategy that could be administered orally and updated quickly in response to emerging avian influenza (AI) variants.

To achieve this, our methodology had to be **accessible**, **adaptable**, and **efficient**—allowing new vaccine variants to be produced at a pace matching the virus’s evolution.

### selecting the phage
Phage selection was one of the earliest and most critical design choices. Initially, we evaluated highly stable species such as PIN1 and PIN2, which can remain viable at room temperature for extended periods (Jati et al.). However, discussions with **Prof. Stan Brouns** (TU Delft) emphasized that robust genetic characterization and engineering feasibility were more essential for our purpose. Based on this, we chose the **T7 bacteriophage**, a well-characterized model with extensive literature, established engineering methods, and reliable performance in laboratory settings.

### evaluating engineering approaches
Many iGEM teams have explored phage genome editing. The **Bacteriophage Recombineering of Electroporated DNA (BRED)** method, used by iGEM Delft 2020 (*PHOCUS*), offers flexible site targeting through homologous recombination but suffers from low yield and labor-intensive screening \[citation\]. These limitations would hinder rapid design iteration, so we sought alternative strategies.

Recent studies (Levrier et al.; Vu et al.) describe **in vitro genome assembly** as a faster, more accessible alternative. These methods combine PCR amplification and DNA assembly to reconstruct full phage genomes, which can then be rebooted in host cells or cell-free systems. No iGEM team had implemented this approach before, making it an innovative opportunity to improve efficiency and modularity in phage engineering.

Given its technical flexibility and minimal reliance on selection procedures, we adopted and optimized this **in vitro assembly strategy** for T7.

### implementation and optimization
Consultations with **Dr. Ana Rita Costa** (Stan Brouns Lab) and **Dr. Sam van Beljouw** (University of Basel) guided our implementation. While cell-free TXTL systems offer precision and control, their high cost and optimization challenges make them less suitable for accessible vaccine development. Instead, we pursued a **cell-based reboot** by transforming competent *E. coli* BL21(DE3) cells with in vitro assembled T7 genomes, a method supported by recent literature (Vu et al.).

To streamline the workflow, Dr. Costa advised extending the PCR denaturation step (5 min) to lyse phage particles directly, eliminating the need for separate DNA extraction.

For the insertion site, we initially considered substituting the non-essential **gene 4.3** (as in PHOCUS 2020) but ultimately selected the region downstream of **gene 10**, which encodes the major capsid protein and offers strong expression potential. This decision was supported by expression analyses from Levrier et al. and expert feedback from Prof. Brouns.

### research goals
1. **Assemble the full T7 phage genome entirely in vitro.**  
   *Rationale:* Enables high-efficiency genome editing without time-consuming selection steps, providing modularity and precise control.
2. **Generate viable phages from the engineered T7 genome.**  
   *Rationale:* Ensures that genetic modifications maintain phage viability, supporting scalable vaccine production in vivo.

### engineering cycle and challenges
The workflow involved three major steps:  
1. PCR amplification of the T7 genome into overlapping fragments with 50 bp homology arms.  
2. DNA assembly using a HiFi DNA assembly reaction.  
3. Transformation of *E. coli* BL21(DE3) cells to reboot phage production.

While conceptually simple, this approach presented technical challenges: long primers reduced PCR efficiency, multi-fragment assembly required careful optimization, and the transformation of large (~40 kb) genomes pushed standard competence limits.

### experimental results and troubleshooting
Using primers from Levrier et al., we amplified both wild-type (wt) and minimized (mini) T7 genome fragments, confirming success by gel electrophoresis. Assemblies were performed using the **NEB HiFi DNA Assembly Kit**, though low DNA concentration (30–60 ng/µL) likely reduced efficiency.

PCR validation with long-range **RepliQa polymerase** indicated incomplete assembly. Following advice from **Ing. Esengül Yildirim** and **Dr. Theo van Laar**, we introduced precautions for handling large DNA molecules—using cut pipette tips to prevent shear stress—and developed a secondary screening method using intermediate fragment primers. This allowed us to verify partial assembly with standard **Q5 polymerase**, simplifying troubleshooting.

We also tripled PCR reaction volumes and minimized elution volume to increase DNA concentration in subsequent assemblies.

### insertion design and testing
To validate genome modification, we planned two insertion variants:  
- **Gene 10 insertion** (wild-type genome)  
- **Gene 4.3 substitution** (minimized genome)

We selected **mCherry** as a visible reporter for easy verification. PCR primers were designed with orthogonal homology sequences (OHOs) adapted from Levrier et al. and Subramanian et al. After optimizing annealing temperatures, all fragments were successfully produced.

Subsequent assemblies were transformed via both heat shock and electroporation. While the **plaque assay** confirmed assay functionality, no plaques formed from the assembled genome, indicating inefficiencies during transformation rather than a flaw in design.

### future outlook
Although full phage reboot was not achieved in this iteration, existing studies confirm the feasibility of this approach. Further optimization of DNA assembly ratios, fragment handling, and transformation efficiency is expected to yield success. Once established, this in vitro assembly workflow could significantly accelerate phage-based vaccine engineering, offering a scalable, modular foundation for synthetic biology applications.
# phage engineering ideation and development

## why do we need phage engineering?

In our project **Snaccine**, we aimed to engineer bacteriophages so they can be administered orally as an avian influenza vaccine.  
Our phage vaccine concept works by hijacking the natural gut microbiome to produce antigen mRNA encapsulated in an **MS2 Virus-like Particle (VLP)**.  

The main goals of this technology are to tackle the rapid development of Avian Influenza (AI) outbreaks, which currently make this virus challenging to vaccinate against. Hence, at an initial stage of our project, we envisioned our phage production process to reflect these specific needs of Snaccine.  

Our methodology had to be:
- Accessible  
- Provide engineering flexibility  
- Efficient enough so vaccine modifications can keep pace with the rapid AI evolution  

---

## choosing the right phage

The type of phage was one of the major choices we had to establish. Initially, we opted for phage species recognized for their **stability properties**, which are invaluable for accessible vaccine storage.  
Candidates included **PIN1** and **PIN2** (Jati et al.), which showed no noticeable degradation when stored at room temperature for one year.

However, after contacting **Prof. Stan Brouns**, an expert in bacteriophages, we recognized that **engineering capacity** and **existing genome characterization** were more crucial aspects for developing a vaccine vector.  

Hence, we chose to work with the **T7 bacteriophage**, one of the most well-characterized DNA bacteriophages with decades of engineering history—making our vaccine more accessible in design and production.

---

## choosing the right engineering approach

Multiple iGEM teams have already implemented a plethora of phage engineering techniques.  
One of the most well-established is **Bacteriophage Recombineering with Electroporated DNA (BRED)**, successfully implemented by the **Delft iGEM team PHOCUS (2020)**.  
BRED relies on homologous recombination and thus provides a great amount of freedom over where the T7 genome can be engineered.  

After consulting with former PHOCUS members, we learned that BRED has **a notoriously low yield** and requires **labor-intensive, iterative selection procedures** to effectively produce modified phages — a challenge PHOCUS experienced firsthand.  
Thus, we began researching **alternative methods** that could provide a more accessible approach with minimal selection procedures.

> *[Figure: Different available engineering techniques]*

In vitro techniques have gained prominence in recent years [citation needed].  
Their main advantage: they generate engineered phages with much higher efficiency **without the presence of non-engineered phages**, unlike recombinant methods like BRED.

Some have already been commercialized, like the **T7Select system**, used by the **2022 Mingdao iGEM team PHACCINE**, who applied it in a phage vaccine technology.  
T7Select uses efficient ligation at a restriction site in **gene 10** of T7, allowing short peptide insertions.  
However, it’s limited to peptide presentation and not compatible with introducing **full genes**—as required in our RNA antigen VLP concept.

Recent studies, such as **Levrier et al.¹** and **Vu et al.²**, demonstrated the potential of **PCR and in vitro complete genome assembly** to produce viable engineered phage genomes.  
Levrier et al.¹ further showed that **Cell-Free Systems (TXTL)** can increase phage production efficiency.  

Thus, because of the **rapid total time**, **technical accessibility**, and **engineering flexibility** of this approach, we decided to examine this novel method ourselves.

---

## implementation of our phage engineering approach

To gain a deeper understanding of this approach, we consulted:
- **Dr. Ana Rita Costa** (Stan Brouns Group)  
- **Dr. Sam van Beljouw** (Basel University, TXTL expert)

We learned that while **TXTL systems** offer higher control and efficiency, they are **expensive** and **challenging to fine-tune**, making them undesirable for our context.  

Based on Dr. Costa’s advice, we opted to **directly transform bacteria** with an in vitro assembled genome to reboot phage production. Specifically, we used **competent BL21 (DE3)** cells — a standard protein expression line also used for phage production.  
This approach was supported by **Vu et al.**, who demonstrated similar success.

For genomic DNA sourcing, Dr. Costa advised that **extending the first PCR melting step to 5 minutes** can replace the need for enzymatic lysis or extraction, simplifying our process significantly.

For insertion site selection, we considered **gene 4.3**, a non-essential region, as it allows insertions without affecting viability and offers space for larger DNA parts. However, **gene 10** was eventually preferred due to its **high expression levels**, supported by data from Levrier et al. and feedback from Prof. Brouns.  

---

## research goals of the module

Our project aimed to engineer the T7 phage genome so that it can induce gut bacteria to produce vaccine mRNA encapsulated in an MS2 VLP.

### 1. assemble a T7 phage genome fully in vitro

**why is this needed?**  
An in vitro genome assembly procedure allows higher efficiency and avoids time-consuming selection procedures. It also provides greater control and flexibility compared to traditional in vivo techniques.

### 2. produce viable T7 phages through the engineered genome

**why is this needed?**  
Ensuring phage viability preserves accessibility and enables efficient propagation within the chicken gut.

## engineering cycle and challenges of phage engineering

Many iGEM teams (e.g., **Phocus** and **Phaccine**) have tackled phage engineering challenges using traditional methods like **BRED** or **T7Select**.  
However, these methods lack the flexibility and efficiency required for Snaccine.

Thus, we explored a **novel in vitro assembly procedure**, inspired by recent literature (Levrier et al., Vu et al.), based on **PCR and DNA assembly**.

**overview of our approach:**
1. Amplify T7 genome fragments via PCR  
2. Combine them using DNA assembly  
3. Introduce assembled genome into competent *E. coli* for phage reboot  

If optimized, this process can produce **exclusively engineered phages**, eliminating the need for iterative CRISPR/Cas selection steps common in BRED.

> *[Figure: Diagram of DNA sequence]*

Despite its conceptual simplicity, several challenges were anticipated:
- Long PCR primers (50 bp) for homology arms reduce efficiency  
- Large-genome DNA assembly requires optimization  
- Transformation with 40 kb DNA inserts is non-trivial  

---

## initial PCR procedure and assembly of the T7 genome

We attempted to produce the T7 genome following **Levrier et al.** primer sequences.  
Both **wild-type (wt)** and **minimized (mini)** versions were tested using Q5 polymerase, extending the melting step to 5 min for T7-derived DNA.

After PCR and **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**, all T7 genome fragments were successfully visualized.

> *Fig. #:* 1% AGE showing lanes wA–D (wild-type fragments) and mA–F (minimized fragments).  
> *Lane L:* 1 kb+ NEB DNA ladder.

We then assembled the fragments using **NEB Hi-Fi Assembly**, with DNA purified via the **NEB Monarch PCR clean-up kit**.  
Although our DNA concentrations (30–60 ng/µL) were suboptimal, we proceeded with assembly and attempted long PCR verification using **RepliQua polymerase**.

The resulting **0.7% AGE** revealed smaller-than-expected products, indicating incomplete genome assembly.

> *Fig. #:* 0.7% AGE of assembly products.  
> Lane 1: Lambda phage genome (reference).  
> Lanes 2–3: wt and mini T7 assembly products.

---

## troubleshooting and optimization

Discussions with **Ing. Esengül Yildirim** and **Dr. Theo van Laar** revealed that:
- Genomic DNA is prone to **shearing**, requiring gentle pipetting (cut pipette tips recommended).
- Long-DNA PCRs (>40 kb) are rare and require optimization.
- Screening shorter mid-region fragments via standard Q5 PCR offers easier validation.

We scaled up PCR reactions 3× and reduced elution volumes to increase DNA yield and concentration.

---

## engineering insertion and new PCR design

Two insertion sites were considered: **gene 4.3** and **gene 10**.  
We split fragment **C** into **C1** and **C2** for standard genome insertions, while **mC–mD** was used for minimized genome substitutions.

For exogenous DNA, we used **mCherry**, available in the lab in a **pRSET B vector**, since it allows easy expression reporting.

Primers were designed based on **orthogonal homologous sequences (OHOs)** from Levrier et al. and Subramanian et al., with ~20 bp flanking each side.

> *Fig. #:* Overview of designed insertion sites (SnapGene images).

After PCR optimization (adjusted annealing temperatures and polymerases), all fragments were successfully amplified.

<Dropdown header="phage stability testing" level={0}>

### overview
Understanding the stability of our **T7 bacteriophage** is essential for developing a reliable oral vaccine platform.  
This module explores how environmental factors such as **temperature**, **pH**, and **encapsulation** affect phage viability during storage and simulated gut passage.  

We framed this work within the **Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL)** cycle to evaluate stability and guide formulation strategies for Snaccine.

---

### design — defining the challenge
For an oral phage vaccine to be effective, the phage must survive both **storage** and **gastrointestinal transit**.  
We identified two main stability challenges:

1. **Temperature sensitivity:** Phages are biological entities whose viability can decline quickly outside optimal conditions.  
2. **Acidic stress:** The stomach’s low pH can inactivate most phages before they reach the intestine.

Our goal was to evaluate how long T7 remains viable under different storage conditions and whether encapsulation could protect it in acidic environments.

---

### build — constructing the test systems
To address both challenges, we developed two complementary assays:

1. **Storage Stability Assay**  
   Equal aliquots of wild-type T7 were stored at **4 °C**, **room temperature (~20 °C)**, and **37 °C** for up to four weeks.  
   Each week, samples were removed and analyzed by plaque assay to measure the number of infectious particles (PFU/mL).

2. **Gut-like pH and Capsule Stability Assay**  
   Buffers were prepared at **pH 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 6.8, and 7.4** to mimic stomach and intestinal conditions.  
   Phages were tested in two formats:  
   - **Free phage suspension**  
   - **Encapsulated phage** using **Lonza Capsugel® capsules** filled with 100 µL of T7 stock  

   All reactions were incubated at **37 °C** to simulate physiological temperature.

> *Encapsulation allowed us to evaluate whether simple capsule enclosures could shield T7 from low-pH inactivation and release it later under neutral conditions.*

### test — evaluating phage viability
The **pH and encapsulation assay** was fully prepared but could not be completed successfully.  
Although plaque assays for these samples failed, the setup was validated and documented, creating a foundation that future iGEM teams can directly reuse and improve.  
This iteration provided valuable insights into experimental coordination, sample timing, and workflow reproducibility.

The **storage stability assay** was successfully completed.  
Plaque assays showed that **T7 remained most stable when stored at 4 °C**, producing clear plaques even after one month.  
**Room temperature samples** maintained moderate viability for several days to weeks, while **incubated samples (37 °C)** lost activity rapidly.  
These results confirm that refrigeration offers the best preservation conditions, though short-term room-temperature handling remains feasible.

### learn — reflections and next steps
Even though the pH and encapsulation tests did not yield viable plaques, this work provided critical learning outcomes for future experimentation.  
We established clear protocols for capsule handling, exposure timing, and pH testing, which future iGEM teams can replicate or refine.  

From the completed storage study, we learned that:  
- **Cold storage (4 °C)** provides the highest long-term stability for T7.  
- **Room temperature** allows limited short-term handling.  
- **High temperatures (37 °C)** lead to rapid inactivation, emphasizing the need for stabilization strategies such as **lyophilization** or **protective excipients**.

These insights complete our DBTL cycle, showing both what works and what still needs optimization in phage stability testing.

---

### conclusion
Although not every experiment succeeded, our team achieved a validated and transparent workflow for assessing phage stability.  
The storage results clearly demonstrate optimal conditions for T7 preservation, while the failed pH and encapsulation assays highlight common challenges future iGEM teams can learn from.  
By documenting both successes and setbacks, we ensure that our work contributes meaningful knowledge to the iGEM community and helps future teams design stronger, more reliable phage-based systems.

**MS2 Capsid Expression in e.coli**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/chicken-modules-overview.webp)

While  optimizing  methods to engineer  bacteriophages (Module A), we also  focused on testing  our  synthetic DNA construct in a plasmid form before  advancing to phage engineering.  This  strategy  allowed  us to verify  that  our **DNA design functions as intended  before  integrating  it  into the more  complex  phage system**. The plasmid was designed to partially  **mimic the effect  that  our  modified  phages**  would  have in the final  vaccine by **driving the production of MS2 virus-like  particles (VLPs) in E. coli**. If  our  construct was designed  correctly, the bacteria  should  produce MS2 VLPs  that  are  correctly  folded and do not aggregate.

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/vlp-complex-and-assembly.webp)

Our engineering journey in Module C was guided by the iterative **Design–Build–Test–Learn**  cycle, where  each  experimental run informed the next. Rather  than  being a linear  process, the development of our MS2 VLP expression system unfolded in multiple  rounds of design refinement, troubleshooting, and protocol  adjustment.

## **Design**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-1.webp)
We began by designing a synthetic plasmid (pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp) containing a T7/lac promoter, the MS2 maturase gene, the coat protein gene, and an MS2 RNA stem loop (*Figure 1*) .


![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/results/module-c-plasmid-schematic.webp)

****Figure 1***. Schematic of the pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp plasmid showing the MS2 stem loop, maturase, and coat protein genes under T7/lac control.*

This construct represented the foundation of our vaccine platform. Alongside the plasmid design, we prepared a detailed workflow for expression and validation, including IPTG induction in E. coli BL21(DE3), cell lysis, SDS-PAGE analysis, PEG precipitation, and TEM imaging. Before moving into experiments, we presented this design to an external protein expression expert, whose advice proved crucial: they emphasized the importance of long, low-temperature inductions to favor solubility and suggested sequencing plasmid DNA from early cultures to confirm construct integrity.

Based on this feedback, we refined our expression plan to use 0.4 mM IPTG at 17 °C for 16 hours, and we added a plasmid isolation and sequencing checkpoint to ensure that mutations or cloning errors would not confound downstream experiments.

## Build and Test


![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-3.webp)
With these refinements, we expressed the construct for the first time and analyzed the lysates by SDS-PAGE. At this stage, our lysis protocol combined enzymatic digestion with lysozyme and mechanical disruption by sonication. The gel, however, produced confusing results: a strong band appeared at ~14  kDa across all lanes, including the negative control (*Figure 2*).
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/sds-page-1.webp)
***Figure 2.** SDS-PAGE analysis of initial MS2 expression showing a strong ~14 kDa band in all samples, including the negative control. The band likely corresponds to lysozyme from the lysis buffer, overlapping with the expected size of the MS2 coat protein.*

After some troubleshooting, we discovered the problem - lysozyme itself has a [molecular weight](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/89833?ef_id=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!10!77378333109598!!!!2329177945372041!!471275954!1238051176326156&cid=bid_sap_prp_r01_co_cp1362_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_bng_dy_pur_con&msclkid=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69) (14.3 kDa) that overlapped with the expected signal from MS2 proteins (13.7kDa). In effect, the lysis enzyme was masking our target. This realization was a turning point: we adjusted the protocol to exclude lysozyme and rely solely on sonication for cell disruption, ensuring that no extraneous proteins would interfere with analysis.

## Learn and Iterate

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-2.webp)
Repeating the experiment with this improved protocol gave a clear outcome. After Bradford normalization to equalize protein content across samples, SDS-PAGE revealed a distinct band at 13.7 kDa  - the expected size of the MS2 coat protein. Importantly, this band appeared only in the induced supernatant fraction, not in the uninduced controls or pellet fractions. This result confirmed that our construct was functional and that the protein was expressed in a soluble, folded form rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies.
![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-4.webp)
With soluble expression established, we advanced to the next stage: concentrating, purifying,  and validating the VLP assemblies. Using PEG precipitation, we concentrated the soluble proteins into a visible pellet, selectively enriching for assembled capsids while leaving background proteins in solution. This pellet was resuspended and analyzed by TEM. The negative-stain micrographs revealed discrete spherical particles approximately 27 nm in diameter, consistent with the expected morphology of MS2 VLPs. This provided strong evidence that our engineered coat proteins not only expressed but also self-assembled into virus-like particles.

## Future development

Encouraged by this  success, we began  designing the next  iteration of the system to demonstrate  modularity. In this version, we planned to encapsulate a “dummy  vaccine RNA” containing a eukaryotic  expression  machinery  inside the MS2 particles. 

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/moduledplasmidbiorender/module-d-plasmid-biorender.webp)
*Figure 3. Plasmid design for the next-generation MS2 system encoding a “dummy vaccine RNA” and optimized coat proteins for RNA packaging and delivery.*

The goal of this  new design (*Figure 3*) is to express and purify the VLPs with the same validated  workflow and then expose them to eukaryotic  cells. If  successful, the uptake of VLPs and expression of the model protein would  confirm the end-to-end functionality of our platform: packaging, delivery, and expression.

Through this iterative process, each experiment guided the next step. Troubleshooting issues like the lysozyme interference, validating expression with sequencing checkpoints, and confirming assembly with PEG precipitation and TEM all strengthened our confidence in the system. By moving through successive rounds of design, testing, and refinement, we established a robust method for producing functional MS2 VLPs in E. coli and laid the groundwork for future iterations carrying custom vaccine payloads.
