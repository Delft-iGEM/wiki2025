## introduction

This section outlines the rationale behind our design choices, the technical challenges encountered,
and the engineering strategies that guided us toward our overarching goal: building an mRNA
vaccine platform capable of adapting to fast-evolving viral threats such as avian influenza.

Our project was divided into several independent modules, allowing parallel progress in the lab.
