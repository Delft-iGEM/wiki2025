## introduction

The Engineering section describes how we applied the iGEM Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) cycle across all modules of the Snaccine platform. Each module represents a specific stage in developing an accessible and modular RNA vaccine system—from phage genome engineering and stability testing to virus-like particle (VLP) production, delivery, and immunogenicity.

We divided our project into a number of modules. These modules are independent of one another,
allowing us to work on them in parallel in the lab.

This section outlines the rationale behind our design choices, the technical challenges encountered,
and the engineering strategies that guided us toward our overarching goal: building an mRNA
vaccine platform capable of adapting to fast-evolving viral threats such as avian influenza.
