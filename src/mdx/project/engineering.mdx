# introduction

The Engineering section describes how we applied the iGEM Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) cycle across all modules of the Snaccine platform. Each module represents a specific stage in developing an accessible and modular RNA vaccine system—from phage genome engineering and stability testing to virus-like particle (VLP) production, delivery, and immunogenicity.

By dividing the project into parallel yet interconnected modules, we were able to iterate rapidly, troubleshoot effectively, and leverage progress in one area to accelerate development in others. This section outlines the rationale behind our design choices, the technical challenges encountered, and the engineering strategies that guided us toward our overarching goal: building a flexible RNA vaccine platform capable of adapting to fast-evolving viral threats such as avian influenza.

<Dropdown header="phage genome engineering" level={0}>

### overview
This module focused on establishing a rapid and flexible bacteriophage genome engineering workflow as the foundation of the Snaccine vaccine platform. Our goal was to design phages capable of colonizing the gut microbiome and driving in situ production of antigen mRNA encapsulated within MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). By leveraging the natural biology of bacteriophages, we sought to develop a vaccine strategy that could be administered orally and updated quickly in response to emerging avian influenza (AI) variants.

To achieve this, our methodology had to be **accessible**, **adaptable**, and **efficient**—allowing new vaccine variants to be produced at a pace matching the virus’s evolution.

### selecting the phage
Phage selection was one of the earliest and most critical design choices. Initially, we evaluated highly stable species such as PIN1 and PIN2, which can remain viable at room temperature for extended periods (Jati et al.). However, discussions with **Prof. Stan Brouns** (TU Delft) emphasized that robust genetic characterization and engineering feasibility were more essential for our purpose. Based on this, we chose the **T7 bacteriophage**, a well-characterized model with extensive literature, established engineering methods, and reliable performance in laboratory settings.

### evaluating engineering approaches
Many iGEM teams have explored phage genome editing. The **Bacteriophage Recombineering of Electroporated DNA (BRED)** method, used by iGEM Delft 2020 (*PHOCUS*), offers flexible site targeting through homologous recombination but suffers from low yield and labor-intensive screening \[citation\]. These limitations would hinder rapid design iteration, so we sought alternative strategies.

Recent studies (Levrier et al.; Vu et al.) describe **in vitro genome assembly** as a faster, more accessible alternative. These methods combine PCR amplification and DNA assembly to reconstruct full phage genomes, which can then be rebooted in host cells or cell-free systems. No iGEM team had implemented this approach before, making it an innovative opportunity to improve efficiency and modularity in phage engineering.

Given its technical flexibility and minimal reliance on selection procedures, we adopted and optimized this **in vitro assembly strategy** for T7.

### implementation and optimization
Consultations with **Dr. Ana Rita Costa** (Stan Brouns Lab) and **Dr. Sam van Beljouw** (University of Basel) guided our implementation. While cell-free TXTL systems offer precision and control, their high cost and optimization challenges make them less suitable for accessible vaccine development. Instead, we pursued a **cell-based reboot** by transforming competent *E. coli* BL21(DE3) cells with in vitro assembled T7 genomes, a method supported by recent literature (Vu et al.).

To streamline the workflow, Dr. Costa advised extending the PCR denaturation step (5 min) to lyse phage particles directly, eliminating the need for separate DNA extraction.

For the insertion site, we initially considered substituting the non-essential **gene 4.3** (as in PHOCUS 2020) but ultimately selected the region downstream of **gene 10**, which encodes the major capsid protein and offers strong expression potential. This decision was supported by expression analyses from Levrier et al. and expert feedback from Prof. Brouns.

### research goals
1. **Assemble the full T7 phage genome entirely in vitro.**  
   *Rationale:* Enables high-efficiency genome editing without time-consuming selection steps, providing modularity and precise control.
2. **Generate viable phages from the engineered T7 genome.**  
   *Rationale:* Ensures that genetic modifications maintain phage viability, supporting scalable vaccine production in vivo.

### engineering cycle and challenges
The workflow involved three major steps:  
1. PCR amplification of the T7 genome into overlapping fragments with 50 bp homology arms.  
2. DNA assembly using a HiFi DNA assembly reaction.  
3. Transformation of *E. coli* BL21(DE3) cells to reboot phage production.

While conceptually simple, this approach presented technical challenges: long primers reduced PCR efficiency, multi-fragment assembly required careful optimization, and the transformation of large (~40 kb) genomes pushed standard competence limits.

### experimental results and troubleshooting
Using primers from Levrier et al., we amplified both wild-type (wt) and minimized (mini) T7 genome fragments, confirming success by gel electrophoresis. Assemblies were performed using the **NEB HiFi DNA Assembly Kit**, though low DNA concentration (30–60 ng/µL) likely reduced efficiency.

PCR validation with long-range **RepliQa polymerase** indicated incomplete assembly. Following advice from **Ing. Esengül Yildirim** and **Dr. Theo van Laar**, we introduced precautions for handling large DNA molecules—using cut pipette tips to prevent shear stress—and developed a secondary screening method using intermediate fragment primers. This allowed us to verify partial assembly with standard **Q5 polymerase**, simplifying troubleshooting.

We also tripled PCR reaction volumes and minimized elution volume to increase DNA concentration in subsequent assemblies.

### insertion design and testing
To validate genome modification, we planned two insertion variants:  
- **Gene 10 insertion** (wild-type genome)  
- **Gene 4.3 substitution** (minimized genome)

We selected **mCherry** as a visible reporter for easy verification. PCR primers were designed with orthogonal homology sequences (OHOs) adapted from Levrier et al. and Subramanian et al. After optimizing annealing temperatures, all fragments were successfully produced.

Subsequent assemblies were transformed via both heat shock and electroporation. While the **plaque assay** confirmed assay functionality, no plaques formed from the assembled genome, indicating inefficiencies during transformation rather than a flaw in design.

### future outlook
Although full phage reboot was not achieved in this iteration, existing studies confirm the feasibility of this approach. Further optimization of DNA assembly ratios, fragment handling, and transformation efficiency is expected to yield success. Once established, this in vitro assembly workflow could significantly accelerate phage-based vaccine engineering, offering a scalable, modular foundation for synthetic biology applications.
# phage engineering ideation and development

## why do we need phage engineering?

In our project **Snaccine**, we aimed to engineer bacteriophages so they can be administered orally as an avian influenza vaccine.  
Our phage vaccine concept works by hijacking the natural gut microbiome to produce antigen mRNA encapsulated in an **MS2 Virus-like Particle (VLP)**.  

The main goals of this technology are to tackle the rapid development of Avian Influenza (AI) outbreaks, which currently make this virus challenging to vaccinate against. Hence, at an initial stage of our project, we envisioned our phage production process to reflect these specific needs of Snaccine.  

Our methodology had to be:
- Accessible  
- Provide engineering flexibility  
- Efficient enough so vaccine modifications can keep pace with the rapid AI evolution

## choosing the right phage

The type of phage was one of the major choices we had to establish. Initially, we opted for phage species recognized for their **stability properties**, which are invaluable for accessible vaccine storage.  
Candidates included **PIN1** and **PIN2** (Jati et al.), which showed no noticeable degradation when stored at room temperature for one year.

However, after contacting **Prof. Stan Brouns**, an expert in bacteriophages, we recognized that **engineering capacity** and **existing genome characterization** were more crucial aspects for developing a vaccine vector.  

Hence, we chose to work with the **T7 bacteriophage**, one of the most well-characterized DNA bacteriophages with decades of engineering history—making our vaccine more accessible in design and production.

---

## choosing the right engineering approach

Multiple iGEM teams have already implemented a plethora of phage engineering techniques.  
One of the most well-established is **Bacteriophage Recombineering with Electroporated DNA (BRED)**, successfully implemented by the **Delft iGEM team PHOCUS (2020)**.  
BRED relies on homologous recombination and thus provides a great amount of freedom over where the T7 genome can be engineered.  

After consulting with former PHOCUS members, we learned that BRED has **a notoriously low yield** and requires **labor-intensive, iterative selection procedures** to effectively produce modified phages — a challenge PHOCUS experienced firsthand.  
Thus, we began researching **alternative methods** that could provide a more accessible approach with minimal selection procedures.

> *[Figure: Different available engineering techniques]*

In vitro techniques have gained prominence in recent years [citation needed].  
Their main advantage: they generate engineered phages with much higher efficiency **without the presence of non-engineered phages**, unlike recombinant methods like BRED.

Some have already been commercialized, like the **T7Select system**, used by the **2022 Mingdao iGEM team PHACCINE**, who applied it in a phage vaccine technology.  
T7Select uses efficient ligation at a restriction site in **gene 10** of T7, allowing short peptide insertions.  
However, it’s limited to peptide presentation and not compatible with introducing **full genes**—as required in our RNA antigen VLP concept.

Recent studies, such as **Levrier et al.¹** and **Vu et al.²**, demonstrated the potential of **PCR and in vitro complete genome assembly** to produce viable engineered phage genomes.  
Levrier et al.¹ further showed that **Cell-Free Systems (TXTL)** can increase phage production efficiency.  

Thus, because of the **rapid total time**, **technical accessibility**, and **engineering flexibility** of this approach, we decided to examine this novel method ourselves.

---

## implementation of our phage engineering approach

To gain a deeper understanding of this approach, we consulted:
- **Dr. Ana Rita Costa** (Stan Brouns Group)  
- **Dr. Sam van Beljouw** (Basel University, TXTL expert)

We learned that while **TXTL systems** offer higher control and efficiency, they are **expensive** and **challenging to fine-tune**, making them undesirable for our context.  

Based on Dr. Costa’s advice, we opted to **directly transform bacteria** with an in vitro assembled genome to reboot phage production. Specifically, we used **competent BL21 (DE3)** cells — a standard protein expression line also used for phage production.  
This approach was supported by **Vu et al.**, who demonstrated similar success.

For genomic DNA sourcing, Dr. Costa advised that **extending the first PCR melting step to 5 minutes** can replace the need for enzymatic lysis or extraction, simplifying our process significantly.

For insertion site selection, we considered **gene 4.3**, a non-essential region, as it allows insertions without affecting viability and offers space for larger DNA parts. However, **gene 10** was eventually preferred due to its **high expression levels**, supported by data from Levrier et al. and feedback from Prof. Brouns.

## research goals of the module

Our project aimed to engineer the T7 phage genome so that it can induce gut bacteria to produce vaccine mRNA encapsulated in an MS2 VLP.

### 1. assemble a T7 phage genome fully in vitro

**why is this needed?**  
An in vitro genome assembly procedure allows higher efficiency and avoids time-consuming selection procedures. It also provides greater control and flexibility compared to traditional in vivo techniques.

### 2. produce viable T7 phages through the engineered genome

**why is this needed?**  
Ensuring phage viability preserves accessibility and enables efficient propagation within the chicken gut.

## engineering cycle and challenges of phage engineering

Many iGEM teams (e.g., **Phocus** and **Phaccine**) have tackled phage engineering challenges using traditional methods like **BRED** or **T7Select**.  
However, these methods lack the flexibility and efficiency required for Snaccine.

Thus, we explored a **novel in vitro assembly procedure**, inspired by recent literature (Levrier et al., Vu et al.), based on **PCR and DNA assembly**.

**overview of our approach:**
1. Amplify T7 genome fragments via PCR  
2. Combine them using DNA assembly  
3. Introduce assembled genome into competent *E. coli* for phage reboot  

If optimized, this process can produce **exclusively engineered phages**, eliminating the need for iterative CRISPR/Cas selection steps common in BRED.

> *[Figure: Diagram of DNA sequence]*

Despite its conceptual simplicity, several challenges were anticipated:
- Long PCR primers (50 bp) for homology arms reduce efficiency  
- Large-genome DNA assembly requires optimization  
- Transformation with 40 kb DNA inserts is non-trivial

## initial PCR procedure and assembly of the T7 genome

We attempted to produce the T7 genome following **Levrier et al.** primer sequences.  
Both **wild-type (wt)** and **minimized (mini)** versions were tested using Q5 polymerase, extending the melting step to 5 min for T7-derived DNA.

After PCR and **1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)**, all T7 genome fragments were successfully visualized.

> *Fig. #:* 1% AGE showing lanes wA–D (wild-type fragments) and mA–F (minimized fragments).  
> *Lane L:* 1 kb+ NEB DNA ladder.

We then assembled the fragments using **NEB Hi-Fi Assembly**, with DNA purified via the **NEB Monarch PCR clean-up kit**.  
Although our DNA concentrations (30–60 ng/µL) were suboptimal, we proceeded with assembly and attempted long PCR verification using **RepliQua polymerase**.

The resulting **0.7% AGE** revealed smaller-than-expected products, indicating incomplete genome assembly.

> Lanes 2–3: wt and mini T7 assembly products.

## troubleshooting and optimization

Discussions with **Ing. Esengül Yildirim** and **Dr. Theo van Laar** revealed that:
- Genomic DNA is prone to **shearing**, requiring gentle pipetting (cut pipette tips recommended).
- Long-DNA PCRs (>40 kb) are rare and require optimization.
- Screening shorter mid-region fragments via standard Q5 PCR offers easier validation.

We scaled up PCR reactions 3× and reduced elution volumes to increase DNA yield and concentration.

## engineering insertion and new PCR design

Two insertion sites were considered: **gene 4.3** and **gene 10**.  
We split fragment **C** into **C1** and **C2** for standard genome insertions, while **mC–mD** was used for minimized genome substitutions.

For exogenous DNA, we used **mCherry**, available in the lab in a **pRSET B vector**, since it allows easy expression reporting.

Primers were designed based on **orthogonal homologous sequences (OHOs)** from Levrier et al. and Subramanian et al., with ~20 bp flanking each side.

> *Fig. #:* Overview of designed insertion sites (SnapGene images).

After PCR optimization (adjusted annealing temperatures and polymerases), all fragments were successfully amplified.

<Dropdown header="MS2 capsid expression in E. coli" level={0}>

### overview
In parallel with phage genome engineering, we validated our DNA construct in plasmid form before integrating it into the phage system. This intermediate step allowed us to test expression and folding of MS2 VLPs in *E. coli*, confirming that the design functioned as intended before advancing to full phage implementation. The objective of this module was to establish a reliable workflow for expressing, purifying, and validating MS2 capsid assembly—core components of the Snaccine vaccine platform.

### design

![alt text](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-1.webp)

We designed a synthetic plasmid (**pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp**) containing a T7/lac promoter, the MS2 maturase gene, the MS2 coat protein gene, and an RNA stem loop. This design mimics the genetic organization that will eventually be carried by the engineered phage.

To validate function, we planned a workflow including IPTG induction in *E. coli* BL21(DE3), cell lysis, SDS-PAGE analysis, PEG precipitation, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Before experimentation, we consulted a protein expression specialist, whose guidance led us to adopt **low-temperature, long-duration induction** (0.4 mM IPTG at 17 °C for 16 h) to enhance solubility and add a **sequencing checkpoint** to verify plasmid integrity prior to expression.

### build and test

![alt text](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-2.webp)
Our initial expression used a combined lysozyme + sonication lysis protocol. However, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a strong band at ~14 kDa in both induced and control samples.
![alt text](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/sds-page-1.webp)
Upon investigation, we realized this band corresponded to lysozyme (14.3 kDa), masking the MS2 coat protein signal (13.7 kDa).

After removing lysozyme and relying solely on **sonication**, the revised experiment yielded a clear 13.7 kDa band exclusively in the induced supernatant fraction—confirming successful, soluble expression of MS2 coat protein.

### learn and iterate

![alt text](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-3.webp)
With expression validated, we advanced to purification and structural confirmation. PEG precipitation concentrated soluble VLPs into a visible pellet, and TEM imaging of negatively stained samples revealed discrete spherical particles approximately 27 nm in diameter—consistent with MS2 morphology.

![alt text](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-4.webp)
This confirmed that the expressed proteins correctly self-assembled into VLPs, validating both the plasmid design and the optimized expression protocol.

### future development
Encouraged by these results, we initiated the design of a second-generation construct to demonstrate system modularity. This version aimed to encapsulate a “dummy vaccine RNA” encoding a eukaryotic reporter gene, testing the platform’s ability to deliver and express payloads in target cells. The same validated workflow—expression, PEG purification, and TEM characterization—will be applied to this construct.

Through iterative application of the Design–Build–Test–Learn cycle, we established a robust and reproducible method for expressing functional MS2 VLPs in *E. coli*. These results provide a strong foundation for the Snaccine platform’s future evolution into a customizable RNA vaccine delivery system.
