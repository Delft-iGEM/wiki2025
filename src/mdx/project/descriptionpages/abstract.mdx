*Snaccine* is a novel type of vaccine, ideal for vaccinating chickens
against avian influenza (bird flu). Genetically edited bacteriophages
are taken orally, in a stomach acid-resistant pill. They reproduce
inside gut bacteria, while also producing RNA packaged within armour,
an MS2 VLP with cell-penetrating peptides. The armoured RNA enters
(eukaryotic) host cells and works like an mRNA vaccine. It tricks the
cell into producing an antigen. This antigen is detected by the immune
system and teaches it to recognise and fight the original pathogen.
Snaccines share the same advantages mRNA technology has over
traditional vaccines. But where typical mRNA vaccines have to be kept
in freezers, *Snaccines* can be stored and transported at room
temperature. Together with their cheaper production and oral
administration, *Snaccine* is an ideal technology for fighting bird
flu.
