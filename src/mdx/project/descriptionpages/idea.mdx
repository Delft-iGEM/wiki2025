Since the successful debut of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic,
ambitious predictions have been made about its potential.
But the mRNA vaccine rollout also laid bare many drawbacks. The vaccines
are kept at <Temperature celsius="−20 °C to −80 °C" fahrenheit="−4 °F to −112 °F" />. This made it hard to transport them to remote
or less-developed regions. mRNA vaccines are more expensive to produce, too.
And the logistical challenge of injecting everyone came at great cost.

As a solution, we present *Snaccine*, a new type of vaccine which uses
bacteriophages to hijack gut bacteria to produce armoured mRNA.

<Dropdown header="what are bacteriophages?" level={0}>

Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses which infect bacteria. There are
more phages in the world than all other organisms combined. There is
great diversity among phages, but the best known are ones that look like
little moon landers with geometric heads like the one in our logo.

In the lab, we use a species of phage called T7, which was isolated from
sewers in 1945 and infects *E. coli* bacteria. The 'armour' we use for
our mRNA is the coat of a smaller phage called MS2. Since this armour
isn't a full phage by itself, it's called a *virus-like particle* or
*VLP*.

Phages attack bacteria, and they can be used to fight bacterial
infections in humans. This 'phage therapy' is used in Russia, Georgia,
and Poland, and in experimental settings in other countries. It's a
possible solution to the growing problem of drug-resistant bacteria.

Vaccines based on phages aren't a new idea. After the Nobel
Prize-winning discovery of how to engineer phages to display peptides on
their surface, many studies investigated the idea of using phages (or
VLPs) to masquerade as a human virus. None of these are approved
anywhere, as of yet. Our method is different still: the (infectious)
phages in turn produce an mRNA vaccine.

<Dropdown header="mRNA vaccines: a recap" level={0}>

Most traditional vaccines contain the targeted virus, or a part of it.
Your body recognises the foreign material and your immune system learns
to recognise and to fight it. When the real virus tries to infect you,
your immune system will be primed to quickly take it out.

mRNA vaccines instead trick your own body into making a part of the
virus. If DNA is the grand blueprint for an organism, mRNA or 'messenger
RNA' is a photocopy of part of it. This photocopy is handed to the
ribosomes, the builders of the cell. In the case of the existing mRNA
vaccines, this injected mRNA hijacks your cell to make the
characteristic 'spikes' of the coronavirus. After their production, the
body recognises them as foreign material, and rest proceeds similarly to
traditional vaccines.

The mRNA, packaged within a membrane called a liposome, starts with a
short cap made of two (modified) nucleotides allowing it to be read and
keeping it from being degraded. It is followed by a 'prologue' called
the 5' UTR, and then the nucleotides AUG. These tell the ribosome to
start building the following spike protein, with a short flag telling
the cell to dump the protein outside the cell. Finally, after an
'epilogue' called the 3' UTR, a very long sequence of A's protects the
mRNA from being degraded from this end.\[b\]

The adaptability of this method allowed Moderna to design its vaccine in
just two days after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was put online. It then takes
only a couple weeks to produce the encapsulated mRNA. Also, since the
mRNA only contains a (non-infectious) part of the virus, there is no
risk of the vaccine infecting the patient. Some traditional vaccines,
such as inactivated or attenuated vaccines, can lead the patient to
spread a vaccine-derived virus, such as with the poliovirus vaccine.
With mRNA vaccines, this is impossible.

## caveats of mRNA vaccines

Despite all the advantages, mRNA vaccines come with some big caveats.

The liposomes are much less stable than traditional vaccines, and have
to be kept very cold. The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at <Temperature celsius="−60 °C" fahrenheit="−76 °F" />,
though it can be kept at regular freezer temperatures for the last two weeks,
and the Moderna vaccine has to be kept at <Temperature celsius="−20 °C" fahrenheit="−4 °F" />.
Many developing and/or remote regions do not have the 'cold chain'
necessary to transport and store vaccines at these temperatures. Doing
that is quite costly, and also an obstacle to using mRNA vaccines to
combat bird flu.

The first mRNA vaccines have proven quite costly so far. Traditional
vaccines are usually a virus in some form, and can be grown in a cell
culture. mRNA vaccines are made by transforming bacteria, growing them,
and harvesting (and purifying) the mRNA. The mRNA then undergoes
chemical steps, such as the creation of the cap, the replacement of all
uridine nucleotides with N1-methylpseudouridine and the packaging of the
mRNA inside liposomes. This makes governments choose the cheaper option
of killing all birds on an infected farm instead.

This is where our vaccine comes in.

At heart Snaccines are mRNA
vaccines, but the factory is inside the gut.

Phages can be chosen to specifically infect one strain of bacteria
in the gut of one animal. This prevents the modified genetic code
spreading into the wild. Though the lab-friendly phage we used in our
proof of concept, T7, isn't stable for long outside of a fridge, there
are many varieties of phages which can survive at room temperature or
above.

Most phages can't survive the low pH of the chicken's 'gizzard', its
second stomach, which is actually an advantage. Phages released from one
chicken wouldn't be able to spread to another, but phages inside a pill
go through the gizzard without a problem.

The presence of lots of phages and lots of lysed (destroyed) bacteria in
the gut would trigger the immune system. This too is actually an
advantage. Many vaccines include so-called 'adjuvants' to trigger the
immune system on purpose, but here that comes for free with the phages.
This strengthened immune response makes the vaccine more effective.

As Snaccines are taken as pills, they are much more practical to
administer. For chickens in specific, the capsules could be added to their
feed or to their water supply. Against human viruses, Snaccines could be
sold at pharmacies or delivered by mail.
