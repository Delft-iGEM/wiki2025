## project inspiration
During our initial brainstorming, vaccines were only a fleeting thought; the true inspiration for our project emerged from the world of bacteriophages. Our direction solidified after reading a pivotal paper published in February 2025, which demonstrated how engineered phages could transform resident gut bacteria into on-site factories for producing therapeutic proteins (Baker et al., 2025). We began exploring ideas for using live engineered phages—a path our supervisors encouraged, noting our university's significant faculty expertise in this field.

With this innovative platform in mind, we turned our attention to a pressing global crisis: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The topic dominated the news, and as we investigated further, the scale of the disaster was staggering. The situation in Europe is critical; during the current epidemiological year, there have been 598 HPAI outbreaks in poultry, leading to the culling of approximately 8 million birds for just 365 detections between March and June 2025 (European Food Safety Authority et al., 2025).

This led us to ask why widespread vaccination isn't the answer. We discovered that current vaccines suffer from a critical "vaccine gap":

-   They don't fully stop the virus from spreading.
-   They are difficult to administer to millions of birds at once.
-   They are slow and expensive to update, a major flaw when shielding against a highly mutative virus.

Connecting this technological potential with the urgent need for a solution formed the basis of our project. The phage platform could be adapted into an orally administered vaccine capable of producing encapsulated mRNA directly within gut bacteria. From this concept, **Snaccine** was born. It is ideal for mass application, and its modular design means it can be rapidly updated to counter new strains, combining an urgent agricultural need with a innovative delivery platform.
