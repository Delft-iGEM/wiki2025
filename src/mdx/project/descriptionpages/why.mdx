We chose this project after a long brainstorming session.
At one point, we mentioned vaccines but only as a side note.

We started thinking about phages after reading an article published just this February (Feb 18 2025): 

> Baker, Z.R., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H. et al. Sustained in situ protein production and release in the mammalian gut by an engineered bacteriophage. *Nat Biotechnol* (2025). https://doi-org.eur.idm.oclc.org/10.1038/s41587-025-02570-7

We came up with some ideas of using infectious (live) engineered phages for different ends, and supervisors
pointed out that our university has faculty with good experience with phages.

A while later, we came across an article about bird flu, and started connecting the dots.
Bird flu was in the news a lot, especially due to the situation in the United States, and fears
that might happen in the Netherlands too.

You can find more about our the problem we address and the potential impact of our solution in the [Human Practices](/human-practices) section.
