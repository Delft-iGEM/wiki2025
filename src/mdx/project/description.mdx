Since the successful debut of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic,
ambitious predictions have been made about its potential.
But the mRNA vaccine rollout also laid bare many drawbacks. The vaccines
are kept at <Temperature celsius="−20 °C to −80 °C" fahrenheit="−4 °F to −112 °F" />. This made it hard to transport them to remote
or less-developed regions. mRNA vaccines are more expensive to produce, too.
And the logistical challenge of injecting everyone came at great cost.

As a solution, we present *Snaccine*, a new type of vaccine which uses
bacteriophages to hijack gut bacteria to produce armoured mRNA.

<Dropdown header="abstract" level={0}>

{/*<div className="md:mx-8 md:p-6">*/}
*Snaccine* is a novel type of vaccine, ideal for vaccinating chickens
against avian influenza (bird flu). Genetically edited bacteriophages
are taken orally, in a stomach acid-resistant pill. They reproduce
inside gut bacteria, while also producing RNA packaged within armour,
an MS2 VLP with cell-penetrating peptides. The armoured RNA enters
(eukaryotic) host cells and works like an mRNA vaccine. It tricks the
cell into producing an antigen. This antigen is detected by the immune
system and teaches it to recognise and fight the original pathogen.
Snaccines share the same advantages mRNA technology has over
traditional vaccines. But where typical mRNA vaccines have to be kept
in freezers, *Snaccines* can be stored and transported at room
temperature. Together with their cheaper production and oral
administration, *Snaccine* is an ideal technology for fighting bird
flu.

<Dropdown header="what are bacteriophages?" level={0}>

Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses which infect bacteria. There are
more phages in the world than all other organisms combined. There is
great diversity among phages, but the best known are ones that look like
little moon landers with geometric heads like the one in our logo.

In the lab, we use a species of phage called T7, which was isolated from
sewers in 1945 and infects *E. coli* bacteria. The 'armour' we use for
our mRNA is the coat of a smaller phage called MS2. Since this armour
isn't a full phage by itself, it's called a *virus-like particle* or
*VLP*.

Phages attack bacteria, and they can be used to fight bacterial
infections in humans. This 'phage therapy' is used in Russia, Georgia,
and Poland, and in experimental settings in other countries. It's a
possible solution to the growing problem of drug-resistant bacteria.

Vaccines based on phages aren't a new idea. After the Nobel
Prize-winning discovery of how to engineer phages to display peptides on
their surface, many studies investigated the idea of using phages (or
VLPs) to masquerade as a human virus. None of these are approved
anywhere, as of yet. Our method is different still: the (infectious)
phages in turn produce an mRNA vaccine.

<Dropdown header="mRNA vaccines: a recap" level={0}>

Most traditional vaccines contain the targeted virus, or a part of it.
Your body recognises the foreign material and your immune system learns
to recognise and to fight it. When the real virus tries to infect you,
your immune system will be primed to quickly take it out.

mRNA vaccines instead trick your own body into making a part of the
virus. If DNA is the grand blueprint for an organism, mRNA or 'messenger
RNA' is a photocopy of part of it. This photocopy is handed to the
ribosomes, the builders of the cell. In the case of the existing mRNA
vaccines, this injected mRNA hijacks your cell to make the
characteristic 'spikes' of the coronavirus. After their production, the
body recognises them as foreign material, and rest proceeds similarly to
traditional vaccines.

The mRNA, packaged within a membrane called a liposome, starts with a
short cap made of two (modified) nucleotides allowing it to be read and
keeping it from being degraded. It is followed by a 'prologue' called
the 5' UTR, and then the nucleotides AUG. These tell the ribosome to
start building the following spike protein, with a short flag telling
the cell to dump the protein outside the cell. Finally, after an
'epilogue' called the 3' UTR, a very long sequence of A's protects the
mRNA from being degraded from this end.\[b\]

The adaptability of this method allowed Moderna to design its vaccine in
just two days after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was put online. It then takes
only a couple weeks to produce the encapsulated mRNA. Also, since the
mRNA only contains a (non-infectious) part of the virus, there is no
risk of the vaccine infecting the patient. Some traditional vaccines,
such as inactivated or attenuated vaccines, can lead the patient to
spread a vaccine-derived virus, such as with the poliovirus vaccine.
With mRNA vaccines, this is impossible.

</Dropdown>

### caveats of mRNA vaccines

Despite all the advantages, mRNA vaccines come with some big caveats.

The liposomes are much less stable than traditional vaccines, and have
to be kept very cold. The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at <Temperature celsius="−60 °C" fahrenheit="−76 °F" />,
though it can be kept at regular freezer temperatures for the last two weeks,
and the Moderna vaccine has to be kept at <Temperature celsius="−20 °C" fahrenheit="−4 °F" />.
Many developing and/or remote regions do not have the 'cold chain'
necessary to transport and store vaccines at these temperatures. Doing
that is quite costly, and also an obstacle to using mRNA vaccines to
combat bird flu.

The first mRNA vaccines have proven quite costly so far. Traditional
vaccines are usually a virus in some form, and can be grown in a cell
culture. mRNA vaccines are made by transforming bacteria, growing them,
and harvesting (and purifying) the mRNA. The mRNA then undergoes
chemical steps, such as the creation of the cap, the replacement of all
uridine nucleotides with N1-methylpseudouridine and the packaging of the
mRNA inside liposomes. This makes governments choose the cheaper option
of killing all birds on an infected farm instead.

This is where our vaccine comes in.

At heart Snaccines are mRNA
vaccines, but the factory is inside the gut.

Phages can be chosen to specifically infect one strain of bacteria
in the gut of one animal. This prevents the modified genetic code
spreading into the wild. Though the lab-friendly phage we used in our
proof of concept, T7, isn't stable for long outside of a fridge, there
are many varieties of phages which can survive at room temperature or
above.

Most phages can't survive the low pH of the chicken's 'gizzard', its
second stomach, which is actually an advantage. Phages released from one
chicken wouldn't be able to spread to another, but phages inside a pill
go through the gizzard without a problem.

The presence of lots of phages and lots of lysed (destroyed) bacteria in
the gut would trigger the immune system. This too is actually an
advantage. Many vaccines include so-called 'adjuvants' to trigger the
immune system on purpose, but here that comes for free with the phages.
This strengthened immune response makes the vaccine more effective.

As Snaccines are taken as pills, they are much more practical to
administer. For chickens in specific, the pills could be added to their
feed or to their water supply. Against human viruses, Snaccines could be
sold at pharmacies or delivered by mail.

### the challenges of producing mRNA vaccines *in vivo*

<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground pl-2 border-l-2">A diagram of the phage's payload, the vaccine-producing DNA. Segment lengths not to scale.</p>

Phages can be grown in bacterial cultures and then filtered out. This
requires fewer chemical processing steps than mRNA vaccines, and saves a
lot on cost.

But where did those non-biological processing steps go?

First, the liposome. Though liposomes are very common in cells, there
isn't enough space in the phage's genome to add everything necessary to
envelop our mRNA in liposomes. That's why instead we chose the coat
protein of the MS2 phage. The MS2 phage has a very short genome, just
3569 nucleotides. In fact, it was the first genome ever to be sequenced.
Its coat protein is just 510 nucleotides long. In the presence of a
certain RNA sequence in the shape of a hairpin, 180 coat proteins come
together to form an icosahedron 27 nm in diameter, the VLP. By adding a
short, very positively charged peptide to the outside of the coat
proteins, it can enter the eukaryotic cells of the gut lining. Through a
process that is not yet fully understood, the VLP then disassembles and
the mRNA escapes.

Then, the cap. mRNA vaccines, and in fact any normal strand of mRNA
produced by a eukaryote, start with a few heavily modified nucleotides.
Bacteria don't make these modifications, and the machinery to do so is
much too large to fit inside the limited space we have available in the
T7 genome. That's why we need to tackle two of the cap's functions,
stability against degradation and the initiation of ribosome
translation, separately.

To initiate translation, we took a leaf from the book of many eukaryotic
viruses. They have a so-called *internal ribosome entry site* or IRES.
IRESes are sequences of a couple hundred nucleotides which form all
sorts of folds (secondary structures) and which allow the ribosome to
attach to the mRNA without a proper cap.

To prevent the cell from degrading the RNA at the 'beginning' (the 5'
end), we propose using hairpin loops, as proposed and tested by
Solodushko et al.\[c\]. In our proof-of-concept experiments in
the lab, we didn't want to add too many possible points of failure, so
we decided to forgo this step and to accept the faster degradation.
Further research could confirm the viability of this approach.

Next up is the replacement of uridine (U) with N1-methylpseudouridine
(m<sup>1</sup>Ψ). This nucleotide, which behaves identically to U in translation,
greatly reduces detection of the mRNA by the internal immune system of
the cell. Bacteria do naturally have pseudouridine (Ψ), for example in
tRNA, but there is no mechanism to replace all U with (m<sup>1</sup>)Ψ. Here
again, we use a combination of solutions.

The positively charged peptide which helps the VLP get into eukaryotic
cells in the first place also helps destabilise the endocytosis
membrane. This already bypasses some immune sensors like Toll-like
receptors 7 and 8, which detect uridine-rich RNA. To fight internal
immune sensors, we can take the exact same approach as the virus we're
trying to stop. Influenza viruses have a protein called NS1, whose job
it is to obstruct the immune sensor RIG-I.\[d\] This protein is short
enough (693 nt) to fit into the MS2 capsid (wild-type genome: 3569 nt),
though it does reduce space for the actual antigenic protein somewhat.
In our lab work we didn't include the influenza NS1 protein as we
decided to use a fluorescent protein as the payload, and also to
simplify the proof of concept.

Finally, eukaryotes generally have a long tail of just adenosine
nucleotides at the end of mRNA transcripts to prevent degradation.
Bacteria don't do this; in fact, they use these 'poly-A tails' to
actively *encourage* degradation. Generally, eukaryotes add poly-A tails
after transcription from the DNA. Since we can't do this in the bacteria
and since eukaryotes only add this tail in the nucleus, we want to
directly encode the poly-A tail into the engineered phage's DNA so it is
transcribed right away. This introduces the problem of polymerase
slippage. The two existing mRNA vaccines prefer to add this poly-A tail
right away too, and they achieve this by putting a 10-nucleotide
'linker' (GCAUAUGACU) inside the poly-A tail. (Trepotec et al.
\[e\]

We made a couple more modifications to our genetic code beyond those
necessary for mRNA vaccines. Though wild MS2 phages contain only one
copy of the coat protein (CP), most studies use two CPs fused together
(by removing the second amino acid of the second CP, a serine). Only the
first CP is fused with the very positive cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)
with a GGGS linker. With only one copy, the 180 CPs with their CPPs
might interfere with each other and not form the VLP. With one CPP-CP
and one CP, not fused, different VLPs would have different numbers of
CPP-CP, possibly avoiding them all together. By fusing them together
(CPP-CP-CP), we ensure exactly 90 CPPs per VLP.

We used DNA synthesis to test just the parts we want to add to the phage
by themselves, as a plasmid. Practical issues mean that we can't
synthesise two somewhat similar sequences in a row, which would be the
case with the two CPs. To this end, we wrote a Python programme which
can generate the two least-alike synonymous DNA sequences for a given
amino acid sequence, as well as the least-alike DNA sequence given a
fixed DNA sequence. We used the latter to create a functional, but in
nucleotides dissimilar CP copy. After changing some base pairs to avoid
restriction sites and to make our construct BioBrick RFC\[10\] and
RFC\[1000\] compatible. We also included a His-tag in the AB loop of the
second CP for easy purification. After the stop codon we placed two more
redundant stop codons, similar to the Pfizer vaccine. An Esp3I site in
between was intended to allow us easy excision of the CPP-CP-CP in case
it didn't form, and we wanted to test just the payload mRNA on a
eukaryote by electroporation.

Like the COVID-19 vaccines, we use the 5' and 3' UTRs from human beta
globin for the vaccine itself, both followed by a MS2 packaging signal
hairpin ('pac site'), again slightly varied to allow easy DNA synthesis.
Following the 5' UTR and its pac site we immediately place the IRES,
itself directly followed by the payload, eGFP. For our plasmids which
emulate what would be the T7's payload, we use T7 promoters and a strain
of *E. coli* with T7 polymerase, BL21(DE3), which fortunately for our
ends is a very common expression system in the lab.
