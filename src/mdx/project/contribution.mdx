<Dropdown header="minimum homology codon optimization algorithm" defaultOpen>

We made an algorithm that generates two DNA sequences that code for the same protein but have minimal sequence similarity. Useful synthesising DNA with vendors whose method doesn't allow long homologous repeats.
We used it to allow synthesis of our MS2 coat protein dimer.

<Dropdown header="improved plaque assay protocol" defaultOpen>

To help other iGEM teams and researchers working with bacteriophages,
we developed an improved plaque assay protocol for T7 phages. We
based it on <Link to="https://www.protocols.io/view/plaque-assay-kqdg35ebqv25/v1" className="underline">a protocol from iGEM Wageningen 2019.</Link>

This protocol saves time by clever mixing, improves clarity, counts plaques slightly differently, and has a greater focus on phage contamination safety measures.

<Dropdown header="new BioBrick parts" defaultOpen>

For future iGEM teams to use, as well as others in the synthetic biology community,
we designed and characterized several new genetic BioBrick-compatible parts.
This composite part, for T7RNAP *E. coli* such as BL21(DE3),
produces a eukaryotic mRNA therapeutic, encapsulated in an MS2 phage capsid (VLP).
The eGFP payload can be replaced with any mRNA of interest, or the entire RNA can be
replaced by other RNA therapies, such as siRNA or gRNA, if the pac signal is included.
