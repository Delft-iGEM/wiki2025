# **MS2 VLP and mRNA vaccine**

# MS2 capsid expression in *E. coli*

While  optimizing  methods to engineer  bacteriophages (Module A), we also  focused on testing  our  synthetic DNA construct in a plasmid form before  advancing to phage engineering.  This  strategy  allowed  us to verify  that  our **DNA design functions as intended  before  integrating  it  into the more  complex  phage system**. The plasmid was designed to partially  **mimic the effect  that  our  modified  phages**  would  have in the final  vaccine by **driving the production of MS2 virus-like  particles (VLPs) in E. coli**. If  our  construct was designed  correctly, the bacteria  should  produce MS2 VLPs  that  are  correctly  folded and do not aggregate.

Our engineering journey in this module, Module C, was guided by the iterative **Design–Build–Test–Learn**  cycle, where  each  experimental run informed the next. Rather  than  being a linear  process, the development of our MS2 VLP expression system unfolded in multiple  rounds of design refinement, troubleshooting, and protocol  adjustment.

## **Design**

![enter image description here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/figures/engineering-module-c-image-1.webp)
We began by designing a synthetic plasmid (pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp) containing a T7/lac promoter, the MS2 maturase gene, the coat protein gene, and an MS2 RNA stem loop (*Figure 1*) .

This construct represented the foundation of our vaccine platform. Alongside the plasmid design, we prepared a detailed workflow for expression and validation, including IPTG induction in E. coli BL21(DE3), cell lysis, SDS-PAGE analysis, PEG precipitation, and TEM imaging. Before moving into experiments, we presented this design to an external protein expression expert, whose advice proved crucial: they emphasized the importance of long, low-temperature inductions to favor solubility and suggested sequencing plasmid DNA from early cultures to confirm construct integrity.

Based on this feedback, we refined our expression plan to use 0.4 mM IPTG at <Temperature celsius="17°C" fahrenheit="63°F" /> for 16 hours, and we added a plasmid isolation and sequencing checkpoint to ensure that mutations or cloning errors would not confound downstream experiments.

## Build and Test

With these refinements, we expressed the construct for the first time and analyzed the lysates by SDS-PAGE. At this stage, our lysis protocol combined enzymatic digestion with lysozyme and mechanical disruption by sonication. The gel, however, produced confusing results: a strong band appeared at ~14  kDa across all lanes, including the negative control (*Figure 2*).

After some troubleshooting, we discovered the problem - lysozyme itself has a [molecular weight](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/89833?ef_id=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!10!77378333109598!!!!2329177945372041!!471275954!1238051176326156&cid=bid_sap_prp_r01_co_cp1362_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_bng_dy_pur_con&msclkid=e5070d01f51d176f577865d097762a69) (14.3 kDa) that overlapped with the expected signal from MS2 proteins (13.7kDa). In effect, the lysis enzyme was masking our target. This realization was a turning point: we adjusted the protocol to exclude lysozyme and rely solely on sonication for cell disruption, ensuring that no extraneous proteins would interfere with analysis.

## Learn and Iterate

Repeating the experiment with this improved protocol gave a clear outcome. After Bradford normalization to equalize protein content across samples, SDS-PAGE revealed a distinct band at 13.7 kDa  - the expected size of the MS2 coat protein. Importantly, this band appeared only in the induced supernatant fraction, not in the uninduced controls or pellet fractions. This result confirmed that our construct was functional and that the protein was expressed in a soluble, folded form rather than aggregating into inclusion bodies.

With soluble expression established, we advanced to the next stage: concentrating, purifying,  and validating the VLP assemblies. Using PEG precipitation, we concentrated the soluble proteins into a visible pellet, selectively enriching for assembled capsids while leaving background proteins in solution. This pellet was resuspended and analyzed by TEM. The negative-stain micrographs revealed discrete spherical particles approximately 27 nm in diameter, consistent with the expected morphology of MS2 VLPs. This provided strong evidence that our engineered coat proteins not only expressed but also self-assembled into virus-like particles.

# Future development &mdash; mRNA therapeutic delivery

Encouraged by this  success, we began  designing the next  iteration of the system to demonstrate  modularity. In this version, we planned to encapsulate a “dummy  vaccine RNA” containing a eukaryotic  expression  machinery  inside the MS2 particles.

*Figure 3. Plasmid design for the next-generation MS2 system encoding a “dummy vaccine RNA” and optimized coat proteins for RNA packaging and delivery.*

The goal of this  new design (*Figure 3*) is to express and purify the VLPs with the same validated workflow and then expose eukaryotic cells to them. If successful, the uptake of VLPs and expression of the model protein would  confirm the end-to-end functionality of our platform: packaging, delivery, and expression.

<ModuleDDesign />

Through this iterative process, each experiment guided the next step. Troubleshooting issues like the lysozyme interference, validating expression with sequencing checkpoints, and confirming assembly with PEG precipitation and TEM all strengthened our confidence in the system. By moving through successive rounds of design, testing, and refinement, we established a robust method for producing functional MS2 VLPs in *E. coli* and laid the groundwork for future iterations carrying custom vaccine payloads.
