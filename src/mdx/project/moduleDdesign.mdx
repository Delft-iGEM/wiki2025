Producing an mRNA vaccine inside
bacteria is not as simple as just putting the mRNA sequence inside the phage
genome. Normal mRNA vaccines involve many post-processing steps which are done
outside of the bacteria which grow the mRNA (all in WHO, 2020). We had to find
ways to mimic these steps inside the bacteria, or to find alternatives. A big
challenge here was the limited space we could free in T7 phages to add our synthetic DNA.

### the mRNA's armour: the liposome becomes the MS2 VLP

First, the liposome. Though liposomes are very common in cells, there
isn't enough space in the phage's genome to add everything necessary to
envelop our mRNA in liposomes. That's why we chose the coat
protein of the MS2 phage instead. The MS2 phage has a very short genome, just
3569 nucleotides. In fact, it was the first genome ever to be sequenced.
Its coat protein is just 510 nucleotides long. In the presence of a
certain RNA sequence in the shape of a hairpin, 180 coat proteins come
together to form an icosahedron 27 nm in diameter, the VLP (sometimes called PLP, virus/phage-like particle). By adding a
short, very positively charged peptide to the outside of the coat
proteins, it can enter the eukaryotic cells of the gut lining. Through a
process that is not yet fully understood, the VLP then disassembles, and
the mRNA escapes.

### the 5' prime cap becomes the IRES and hairpin loops

Next, the 5' cap on mRNA. mRNA vaccines, and in fact any normal strand of mRNA
produced by a eukaryote, start with a few heavily modified nucleotides.
Bacteria don't make these modifications, and the machinery to do so is
much too large to fit inside the limited space we have available in the
T7 genome. That's why we need to tackle two of the cap's functions,
stability against degradation and the initiation of ribosome
translation, separately.

#### an IRES to initiate translation

To initiate translation, we took a leaf from the book of many eukaryotic
viruses. They have a so-called *internal ribosome entry site* or IRES.
IRESes are sequences of a couple hundred nucleotides which form all
sorts of folds (secondary structures) and which allow the ribosome to
attach to the mRNA without a proper cap.

#### hairpin loops to prevent degradation

To prevent the cell from degrading the RNA at the 'beginning' (the 5'
end), we propose using hairpin loops, as proposed and tested by
Solodushko et al. (2025) just this February. In our proof-of-concept experiments in
the lab, we didn't want to add too many possible points of failure, so
we decided to forgo this step and to accept the faster degradation.
Further research could confirm the viability of this approach.

#### avoiding detection: m<sup>1</sup>Ψ becomes HIV-TAT and NS1

Next up is the replacement of uridine (U) with N1-methylpseudouridine
(m<sup>1</sup>Ψ). This nucleotide, which behaves identically to U in translation,
greatly reduces detection of the mRNA by the internal immune system of
the cell. Bacteria do naturally have pseudouridine (Ψ), for example in
tRNA, but there is no mechanism to replace all U with (m<sup>1</sup>)Ψ. Here
again, we use a combination of solutions.

The aforementioned positively charged peptide (cell-penetrating peptide or CPP, specifically HIV-TAT) which helps the VLP get into eukaryotic
cells in the first place, also helps destabilise the endocytosis
membrane. This already bypasses some immune sensors like Toll-like
receptors 7 and 8, which detect uridine-rich RNA.

To fight internal
immune sensors, we can take the exact same approach as the virus we're
trying to stop. Influenza viruses have a protein called NS1, whose job
it is to obstruct the immune sensor RIG-I (Heui Seo et al., 2002). This protein is short
enough (693 nt) to fit into the MS2 capsid (wild-type genome: 3569 nt),
though it does reduce space for the actual antigenic protein somewhat.
In our lab work we didn't include the influenza NS1 protein as we
decided to use a fluorescent protein as the payload, and also to
simplify the proof of concept.

#### the poly-A tail stays hard-coded

Finally, eukaryotes generally have a long tail of just adenosine
nucleotides at the end of mRNA transcripts to prevent degradation.
Bacteria don't do this; in fact, they use these 'poly-A tails' to
actively *encourage* degradation. Generally, eukaryotes add poly-A tails
after transcription from the DNA. Since we can't do this in the bacteria
and since eukaryotes only add this tail in the nucleus, we want to
directly encode the poly-A tail into the engineered phage's DNA so it is
transcribed right away. This introduces the problem of polymerase
slippage. The two existing mRNA vaccines prefer to add this poly-A tail
right away, too, and they achieve this by putting a 10-nucleotide
'linker' (GCAUAUGACU) inside the poly-A tail (Trepotec et al., 2019).

#### fusing coat proteins for stability

We made a couple more modifications to our genetic code beyond those
necessary for mRNA vaccines. Though wild MS2 phages contain only one
copy of the coat protein (CP), most studies use two CPs fused together
(by removing the second amino acid of the second CP, a serine). Only the
first CP is fused with the very positive cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)
with a GGGS linker. With only one copy, the 180 CPs with their CPPs
might interfere with each other and not form the VLP. With one CPP-CP
and one CP, not fused, different VLPs would have different numbers of
CPP-CP, possibly avoiding them altogether. By fusing them
(CPP-CP-CP), we ensure exactly 90 CPPs per VLP.

#### optimising DNA synthesis with our Python tool and further small changes

We use DNA synthesis to test just the parts we want to add to the phage
by themselves, as a plasmid. Practical issues mean that we can't
synthesise two somewhat similar sequences in a row, which would be the
case with the two CPs. To this end, <Link to="/contribution" className="underline">we wrote a Python tool which
can generate the two least-alike synonymous DNA sequences for a given
amino acid sequence, as well as the least-alike DNA sequence given a
fixed DNA sequence.</Link> We used the latter to create a functional, but
nucleotide-dissimilar CP copy. After changing some base pairs to avoid
restriction sites and to make our construct BioBrick RFC\[10\] and
RFC\[1000\] compatible. We also included a His-tag in the AB loop of the
second CP for easy purification. After the stop codon we placed two more
redundant stop codons, similar to the Pfizer vaccine. An Esp3I site in
between was intended to allow us easy excision of the CPP-CP-CP in case
it didn't form, and we wanted to test just the payload mRNA on a
eukaryote by electroporation.

#### promoters, UTR choice and MS2 pac sites

Like the COVID-19 vaccines, we use the 5' and 3' UTRs from human beta
globin for the vaccine itself, both followed by an MS2 packaging signal
hairpin ('pac site'), again slightly varied to allow easy DNA synthesis.
Following the 5' UTR and its pac site, we immediately place the IRES,
in turn followed by the payload, eGFP. For our plasmids, which
emulate what would be the T7's payload, we use T7 promoters and a strain
of *E. coli* with T7 polymerase, BL21(DE3), which fortunately for our
ends is a very common expression system in the lab.
