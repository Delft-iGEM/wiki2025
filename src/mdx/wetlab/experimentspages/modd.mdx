# mRNA delivery to mammalian cells

In this module, we designed a new plasmid encoding MS2 capsids that encapsulate an RNA cargo (such as eGFP) — serving as a model for the final vaccine RNA. The goal will be to test whether these RNA-loaded capsids can deliver genetic material into mammalian cells.
Following expression and purification using the same optimized workflow established in the previous module (MS2 Capsid Production in _E. coli_), the purified VLPs will be applied to mammalian cell cultures. Uptake and expression will then be evaluated by monitoring fluorescence, as successful delivery and translation of the eGFP RNA cargo would result in visibly green, fluorescent cells.
Sadly, we didn't manage to finish this in the limited lab time we had before lectures started and we had to stop our lab work. We ordered and received the plasmid, but didn't have time for anything else.
