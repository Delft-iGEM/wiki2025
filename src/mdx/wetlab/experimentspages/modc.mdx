# MS2 capsid production in *E. coli*

This module tests whether *E. coli* can express and assemble MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) from a synthetic plasmid under T7 promoter control. Expression and folding are confirmed by SDS-PAGE and TEM imaging. Successful results validate our plasmid design and establish a foundation for transferring VLP production into engineered phages.
