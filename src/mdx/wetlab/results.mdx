## Overview
We evaluated whether our synthetic plasmid construct could produce MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) in *E. coli* BL21(DE3).  
Our experiments confirmed this: bacteria expressed the MS2 coat protein, which folded correctly and self-assembled into complete VLPs. This validates the feasibility of our vaccine platform.

## SDS-PAGE Analysis of MS2 Expression
SDS-PAGE results confirmed successful expression of the MS2 coat protein:  
- A distinct ~14 kDa band appeared in the induced supernatant (Lane 1), absent in uninduced controls.  
- The majority of protein remained soluble, indicating correct folding.  
- Only faint amounts were observed in the pellet, suggesting minimal aggregation.  

This demonstrates robust IPTG induction and protein solubility.

A clear band at ~14 kDa confirms expression of the MS2 coat protein.

## TEM Imaging of MS2 VLPs
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validated that the expressed proteins assembled into VLPs:  
- Particles of ~25–30 nm diameter were observed.  
- Averaged images confirmed icosahedral symmetry typical of MS2 capsids.

## Summary
- MS2 coat protein was successfully expressed in *E. coli*.  
- SDS-PAGE confirmed soluble protein at ~14 kDa.  
- TEM validated proper folding and capsid assembly into VLPs.  

Next steps: engineering plasmids with RNA cargo (e.g., GFP or H5N1 mRNA vaccine insert) to test encapsulation, stability, and delivery efficiency.  

This module demonstrates the successful production of recombinant MS2 VLPs, establishing a foundation for their use as customizable RNA delivery platforms.
