## Module A

**16th – 29th June:**  
Reviewed the PHEIGES paper, Levrier et al, supplementary material, and performed primer design. Discussed PCR protocol with Rita.

**1st – 7th July:**  
Ordered primers, performed PCR WT, and finalized the design of mCherry insert fragments.

**7th – 11th July:**  
Conducted PCR and performed the first Gibson assembly trial.

**14th – 19th July:**  
Performed the first screening trials of Gibson assembly. Carried out insertion PCRs and the first infection/transformation procedure.

**18th – 22nd August:**  
Scaled up PCRs and tested Cohos again using Q5 polymerase. Designed and ordered GA screening primers.

**25th – 29th August:**  
Scaled up PCRs of Cohos and mCherry.

**1st – 5th September:**  
Performed Gibson assembly and conducted a plaque assay.

**8th – 12th September:**  
Carried out the second Gibson assembly trial.

## Module B

**23rd – 24th August:**  
Prepared buffers for the phage pH test.

**24th – 25th August:**  
Encapsulated phages (or left non-encapsulated controls) into Lonza capsules and introduced them into the appropriate pH test setups.

**26th – 30th August:**  
Collected results from pH exposure trials and began analysis of phage stability under different pH conditions.

**1st – 5th September:**  
Prepared follow-up pH test replicates with adjusted buffer compositions to validate previous results.

**8th – 12th September:**  
Performed additional phage encapsulation trials with modified capsule concentrations and recorded comparative efficiency.

**15th – 19th September:**  
Analyzed data from all pH and encapsulation experiments; summarized findings for integration into overall wet lab progress.

## Module C

**16th – 22nd June:**  
Conducted literature search and prepared experimental protocols.

**23rd – 29th June:**  
Continued literature search and protocol preparation.

**30th June – 6th July:**  
Poured LB Kanamycin plates and prepared plasmid DNA (resuspension). Transformed the MS2 VLP plasmid into DH5α for long-term storage and into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Performed miniprep of BL21(DE3) transformants to confirm successful transformation, followed by plating of transformed BL21(DE3).

**7th – 13th July:**  
Prepared protocols for protein expression and consulted with experts.

**14th – 20th July:**  
Inoculated BL21(DE3) overnight culture. Prepared 1000X kanamycin stock. Induced protein expression with IPTG, followed by harvest and lysis. Conducted SDS-PAGE protein gel electrophoresis.

**11th – 17th August:**  
Set up overnight cultures. Performed protein expression, harvest, and lysis.

**18th – 24th August:**  
Ran SDS-PAGE protein gels. Performed PEG precipitation of MS2 VLP samples.

**1st – 5th September:**  
Acquired TEM images of MS2 VLPs. Conducted image processing and data analysis.

## HP

**Weeks 1–6:**  
- Defined HP goals and RRI/VSD/SbD approach  
- Drafted consent and outreach  
- Mapped stakeholders and key questions.

**Weeks 7–15:**  
- Converged on _E. coli_ + T7/MS2  
- Set up ongoing technical mentorship

**Weeks 16–31:**  
- Reviewed Environmental Risk Assessment  
- Framed Differentiation of Infected and Vaccinated Animals  
- Built HP/iHP structure and interview kits

**Weeks 32–41:**  
- Refined regulator and manufacturer background materials

**Weeks 42–50:**  
- Stakeholders validated HA-only (DIVA)  
- Trade constraints  
- First meeting about manufacturing: GMP expectations; purification focus on endotoxins; keep formulation end-user-driven

**Weeks 51–52:**
