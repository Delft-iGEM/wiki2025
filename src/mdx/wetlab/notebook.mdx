## Module A

**16th – 29th June:**  
Reviewed the PHEIGES paper, Levrier et al, supplementary material, and performed primer design. Discussed PCR protocol with Rita.

**1st – 7th July:**  
Ordered primers, performed PCR WT, and finalized the design of mCherry insert fragments.

**7th – 11th July:**  
Conducted PCR and performed the first Gibson assembly trial.

**14th – 19th July:**  
Performed the first screening trials of Gibson assembly. Carried out insertion PCRs and the first infection/transformation procedure.

**18th – 22nd August:**  
Scaled up PCRs and tested Cohos again using Q5 polymerase. Designed and ordered GA screening primers.

**25th – 29th August:**  
Scaled up PCRs of Cohos and mCherry.

**1st – 5th September:**  
Performed Gibson assembly and conducted a plaque assay.

**8th – 12th September:**  
Carried out the second Gibson assembly trial.

Module B:

**23th – 24th August:**
Preparation of the buffers for the phage pH test

**24th – 25th August:**
Encapsulation of the phages (or not for the non-encapsulated ones) into Lonza capsules and introducing them each to the right pH test

## Module C:

**16th – 22nd June:**  
Conducted literature search and prepared experimental protocols.

**23rd – 29th June:**  
Continued literature search and protocol preparation.

**30th June – 6th July:**  
Poured LB Kanamycin plates and prepared plasmid DNA (resuspension). Transformed the MS2 VLP plasmid into DH5α for long-term storage and into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Performed miniprep of BL21(DE3) transformants to confirm successful transformation, followed by plating of transformed BL21(DE3).

**7th – 13th July:**  
Prepared protocols for protein expression and consulted with experts.

**14th – 20th July:**  
Inoculated BL21(DE3) overnight culture. Prepared 1000X kanamycin stock. Induced protein expression with IPTG, followed by harvest and lysis. Conducted SDS-PAGE protein gel electrophoresis.

**11th – 17th August:**  
Set up overnight cultures. Performed protein expression, harvest, and lysis.

**18th – 24th August:**  
Ran SDS-PAGE protein gels. Performed PEG precipitation of MS2 VLP samples.

**1st – 5th September:**  
Acquired TEM images of MS2 VLPs. Conducted image processing and data analysis.

## HP

**Weeks 1–6 — Setup**  
- Defined HP goals and RRI/VSD/SbD approach
- drafted consent and outreach
- mapped stakeholders and key questions.

**Weeks 7–15 — Feasibility**  
- converged on _E. coli_ + T7/MS2
- set up ongoing technical mentorship

**Weeks 16–31 — Regulatory & Implementation Groundwork**  
- reviewed Environmental Risk Assessment 
- framed Differentiation of Infected and Vaccinated Animals
- built HP/iHP structure and interview kits

**Weeks 32–41 — Pre-briefs & Materials**  
- refined regulator and manufacturer bachground materials

**Weeks 42–50 — Expert Inputs → Pivots**  
- stakeholders validated HA-only (DIVA) 
- trade constraints
- first meeting about manufacturing:  GMP expectations; purification focus on endotoxins; keep formulation end-user-driven

**Weeks 51–52 — Regulatory Pivot**  
- Regulatory Input: Snaccine is treated as single GMO; shedding is primary hazard 
- second meeting about manufacturing:  refined purification; end-user-informed formulation

**Weeks 53–59 — End-User & Sector Reality**  
- End-user Input: prefer powder/water mix-in
- Communication Input: clear leaflet and pictograms
- Trade hurlde flagged: adoption hindered by market access & surveillance burden
- End-user Input: drinking-water delivery is practical and scalable
