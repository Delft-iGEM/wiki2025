**Materials:** 
 - BL21 (DE3) E. coli heat shock competent cells (NEB C2527H)
 - Assembly reaction product (see Genome Assembly)
 - Thermostat
 - SOC 
 - LB  
 - Overnight *E. coli* culture 
 - 50-mL flask  
 - 2-ml tube 
 - Scissors
 - Ice 

**Procedure:**
1.	Thaw competent cells on ice for ~ 15 min. 
2.	Cut the tip of a pipette tip with scissors, and carefully pipette 5 μL of assembly reaction product into 50 μL of competent cells. Carefully flick the tube 5 times. 
3.	Incubate for 30 min.
4.	Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 10 seconds. Do not mix.
5.	Immediately place on ice
6.	Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
7.	Place at 37°C for 2 hours. Shake at 150 rpm. 
8.	Add 5 mL of LB to a 50 mL flask and mix in 100 μL of the overnight *E. coli* with the SOC mixture. 
9.	Place at 37°C overnight. Shake at 150 rpm.
