**Materials**

-   Agarose
-   1× TAE buffer (Tris-Acetate-EDTA)
-   SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain
-   NEB Purple Gel Loading Dye6
-   NEB 1 kb+ DNA Ladder7
-   Power supply ([**PowerPac™ HC Power Supply**](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/sku/1645052-powerpac-hc-power-supply?ID=1645052 "PowerPac™ HC Power Supply") 1645052)
-   UV transilluminator with blue filter (**Molecular Imager® Gel Doc™ XR+ System #1708195EDU)**
-   Electrophoresis chamber and casting tray

**Procedure**


1.	Add 1 g of agarose to a glass flask and fill up with 1x TAE buffer to 100mL. Add ~5 mL of MilliQ water 
2.	Microwave at higher power for 1 min and 30 s
3.	In the meantime, set up a gel casting tray with the corresponding well comb.
4.	Swirl agarose solution to dissolve any remaining solid agarose
5.	Microwave for another 30 s
6.	Pipette 5 μL of SYBR Safe into ~50 mL of molten agarose and swirl to mix in
7.	Carefully cast the molten agarose
8.	Wait to solidify for ~ 10 min 
9.	Mix 8 μL of MilliQ water with 2 μL of the corresponding DNA sample and 2 μL of 6x DNA loading dye in a 0.2 mL tube. (Prepare master mix of water and loading dye if needed) 
10.	Place solidified gel in a gel electrophoresis chamber filled with TAE and remove the comb from the gel 
11.	Load DNA samples and DNA ladder into the gel. 
12.	Run gel at 100 V for about 1 h (to change depending on the size of samples)
13.	Carefully take the gel and image under the UV illumination, through a blue filter.
