**_Q5 polymerase PCR protocol_**  
**Materials**

-   Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix5
-   T7 bacteriophages in LB (~0.7 PFU/μL)
-   PCR primers (wild-type, mCherry insert) [reference to Design]
-   NEB Tm Calculator 4
-   Thermocycler
-   0.2-mL PCR tubes (strips)

**Procedure**

0.	Set up the corresponding thermocycler protocol 
1.	Pipette all individual PCR primer pairs in separate 0.2-mL tubes. 
2.	Prepare a PCR master mix. Mix the total MilliQ water, Q5 Master Mix solution, and starting DNA material (1 μL of T7 phages for T7 genome fragments or 10 ng of plasmid containing the mCherry gene) needed for all PCRs on ice. Do not vortex, but pipette up and down to mix well. If adding T7 phages, make sure you are doing this in a separate T7 phage bench separated from the rest of the lab to prevent phage contamination.
3.	Add the PCR master mix solution from the previous step to each tube. Pipette up and down carefully to mix the sample.
4.	Close tubes carefully and transfer to the thermocycler.
