###### Materials

* Sigma-Aldrich 100 kDa protein purification filter columns
* Microcentrifuge (capable of 10,000 rpm)
* 1.5 mL tube
* LB medium

###### Procedure

1. Place the filter column into its corresponding collection tube
2. To equilibrate the filter pipette in 400 μL of LB
3. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. Remove the outflow solution
4. Pipette in 400 μL of filtered T7 phage solution (see T7 filtration)
5. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. Remove the outflow solution
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 four times. For the last step, centrifugation time should be 1.5 min, which should ensure a phage sample volume of ~100 μL
7. Invert column into a new collection tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 10,000 rpm
8. Store concentrated T7 phage sample at 4 °C
