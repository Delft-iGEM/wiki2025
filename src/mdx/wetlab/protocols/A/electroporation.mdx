###### Materials

* BL21 (DE3) electrocompetent cells (see Comp. cell prep)
* Pulse generator
* Voltage cell
* Assembly reaction product (see Genome Assembly)
* SOC
* LB
* Overnight E. coli culture
* 50 mL flask
* 2 ml tube
* Scissors
* Ice

###### Procedure

1. Thaw electrocompetent BL21 (DE3) cells for ~15 min
2. Cut the tip of a pipette tip with scissors, and carefully pipette 5 μL of assembly reaction products into separate 50 μL of competent cells. Carefully flick the tube 5 times.
3. Incubate for 30 min on ice
4. Carefully pipette with a pre-cut pipette tip the cell culture into the electrocuvette
5. Electroshock with pulse generator (Setting 2 ….).
6. Immediately add 950 μL of RT SOC.
7. Transfer solution to a 2 mL tube and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. Shake at 150 rpm.
8. Add 5 mL of LB to a 50 mL flask and mix in 100 μL of the overnight E. coli with the SOC mixture outgrowth.
9. Place at 37°C overnight. Shake at 150 rpm.
