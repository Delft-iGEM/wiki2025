**Materials**

-   NEB Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit
-   Centrifuge (capable of 13,000 rpm)
-   1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
-   Parafilm sheet
-   NanoDrop spectrophotometer [add brand/model number]

**Procedure**  
1.	Insert a clean-up column into the collection tube.
2.	Load 450 μL of this mix into the clean-up column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard outflow and repeat for the residual 450 μL. 
3.	Add 200 μL of WZ washing buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard outflow and repeat. 
4.	 Centrifuge again for 1 min to remove any residual WZ buffer. 
5.	Transfer the column to a 1.5 mL tube and elute with 5 μL of EZ elution buffer, which has been preheated at 50 °C. Ensure the buffer is pipetted into the filter and there is no buffer on the walls of the tube. 
6.	Incubate for 5 min at RT and centrifuge to obtain the final concentrated DNA sample of the T7 genome fragment 
7.	Pipette 1.5 μL drops of EZ buffer on [parafilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parafilm) and add to them 0.5 μL of the final eluted sample. 
8.	Measure the DNA concentration of the drops on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Multiply by 4 to obtain the concentration of the original eluted fragment.
