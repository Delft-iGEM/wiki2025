###### Materials:
- Overnight culture of BL21 (DE3) *E. coli*
- LB medium
- OD<sub>600</sub> of fresh BL21 culture
- Autoclaved Glycerol
- PIPETBOY with sterile 40 mL serological pipettes
- Centrifuge (able to reach 6,000 RPM)

###### Procedure:
1. Add 10 ml of fresh LB medium to two 50 ml flasks each.
2. Inoculate with 100 μL of an overnight BL21 culture. Incubate the bacteria culture at 37 °C for ~ 3 hours until OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.6.
3. Transfer cell solution to a sterile tube compatible with a centrifuge on ice.
4. Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 6,000 RPM (precooled to 4 °C). Remove promptly and pour off supernatant.
5. Wash by adding 20 ml of chilled 10% glycerol to each tube, then pipetting up and down 3-4 times.
6. Centrifuge for 3.5 minutes. Remove promptly and pour off supernatant.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 times. Ensure supernatant is fully removed after the last centrifugation
8. Resuspend in approximately 100 μl of 10% glycerol in each flask.
9. Aliquot 50 μl in 2 ml tubes (4 tubes in total).
10. Store at -80 °C or use directly for electroporation.
