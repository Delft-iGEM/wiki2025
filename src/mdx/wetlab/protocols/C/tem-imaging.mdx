###### Materials
- Induced & uninduced VLPs
- Carbon-coated copper grids (400-mesh)
- Milli-Q water; **1–2%** uranyl acetate (negative stain)
- Glow-discharge unit
- TEM (80–120 kV), tweezers, dust-free drying box

###### Grid Preparation
1. Glow-discharge grids **60 s** in air; store dust-free.

###### Sample & Stain
1. Place **3 µL** sample on Parafilm; place grid (carbon side down) **60 s**; blot.
2. Float on **10 µL** **2%** uranyl acetate **60 s**; wick; air-dry.
3. Repeat for uninduced sample.

###### Imaging
1. Load grid; operate TEM at **~100 kV** (bright-field).
2. Optimize apertures & astigmatism; focus on thin stain film.
3. Capture overviews (**10–20k×**) and details (**50–100k×**) for both samples.
