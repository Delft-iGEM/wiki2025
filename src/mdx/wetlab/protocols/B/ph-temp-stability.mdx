###### Purpose
Evaluate T7 bacteriophage stability when stored at different temperatures over several weeks.

---

###### Experimental Design
- Temperatures tested: **<Temperature celsius="4 °C" fahrenheit="39.2 °F" /> (fridge)** (effectively control), **~<Temperature celsius="20 °C" fahrenheit="68 °F" /> (room temperature)**, and **<Temperature celsius="37 °C" fahrenheit="98.6 °F" /> (incubator)**  
- Duration: **4 weeks total**  
- Samples made: 4 weeks and 1 week of the room temperature and incubated conditions. The samples were kept in the fridge before being tested. The fridge sample acts as a baseline.
- The goal was to assess **long-term viability and stability** of T7 phages under different storage conditions.

###### Materials
- T7 bacteriophage stock solution
- Incubator for use only in phage area
- Materials for plaque assay (*E. coli* culture, plates, see [plaque assay protocol](./protocols#plaqueAssay))

###### Methods
The sample preparation steps are performed at different times, so that they are all ready
for analysis at the same time.

1. Label tubes for each temperature and timepoint.
2. Aliquot equal volumes of T7 phage stock into all tubes.  
3. Place sets of tubes into the respective temperature environments:
   - **<Temperature celsius="4 °C" fahrenheit="39.2 °F" />:** refrigerator shelf  
   - **<Temperature celsius="20 °C" fahrenheit="68 °F" />:** room bench in [phage area](./safety-and-security) or drawer away from direct light  
   - **<Temperature celsius="37 °C" fahrenheit="98.6 °F" />:** [phage area](./safety-and-security) incubator  
4. Perform a [plaque assay](./protocols#plaqueAssay) on all samples.

###### Notes
- Avoid repeated freeze–thaw or temperature cycling.  
- Keep all tubes clearly labeled to prevent mix-ups.
