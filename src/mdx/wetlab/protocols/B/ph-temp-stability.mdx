###### Purpose
Evaluate T7 bacteriophage stability when stored at different temperatures over several weeks.

---

###### Experimental Design
- Temperatures tested: **4 °C (fridge)**, **~20 °C (room temperature)**, and **37 °C (incubator)**  
- Duration: **4 weeks total**  
- Each week, **three tubes** of bacteriophage stock were placed at each temperature.  
- This setup created samples exposed for **1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks** at each temperature.  
- The goal was to assess **long-term viability and stability** of T7 phages under different storage conditions.

###### Materials
- T7 bacteriophage stock solution  
- Sterile microcentrifuge tubes (labeled by temperature & week)  
- 4 °C refrigerator  
- Room temperature bench (~20 °C)  
- 37 °C incubator  
- Timer or logbook for weekly tracking

###### Methods
1. Label tubes for each temperature and timepoint (e.g., *4 °C – Week 1*, *37 °C – Week 4*).  
2. Aliquot equal volumes of T7 phage stock into all tubes.  
3. Place sets of tubes into the respective temperature environments:  
   - **4 °C:** refrigerator shelf  
   - **20 °C:** room bench or drawer away from direct light  
   - **37 °C:** incubator  
4. Each week, add **three fresh tubes** to each temperature group.  
5. Continue until all four weekly sets have been stored for their respective durations.  
6. At each week's end, retrieve that set of tubes for downstream **plaque assay** analysis.

###### Notes
- Avoid repeated freeze–thaw or temperature cycling.  
- Keep all tubes clearly labeled to prevent mix-ups.  
- Compare PFU/mL over time to determine stability trends.
