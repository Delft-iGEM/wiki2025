###### Materials
- LBa plates (1.5% agar)
- Soft/top agar (0.4–0.7% agar, molten at 55 °C)
- Host bacteria culture (OD₆₀₀ = 0.4–0.6)
- LB broth
- Sterile pipette tips, microtubes
- Phage stock solutions
- Water bath (55 °C)
- Sterile spreaders
- 37 °C incubator

###### Methods
**A. Plate & Bacterial Preparation**
1. Prepare LBa plates (1.5% agar).  
2. Melt soft/top agar (0.4–0.7%) and equilibrate to 55 °C before use.  
3. Mix 100 µL host bacteria with ~5 mL molten top agar and pour evenly.  
4. Let solidify for ~5 min.  

**B. Phage Serial Dilutions**
1. Dispense 180 µL LB into each dilution tube.  
2. Add 20 µL phage stock to the first tube (10⁻¹).  
3. Transfer 20 µL sequentially up to 10⁻⁶.  
4. Mix and change tips each time.  

**C. Spotting**
1. Apply ~4 µL of each dilution to the agar surface.  
2. Do 3 replicates per dilution.  
3. Let dry, then incubate inverted at 37 °C overnight.  

**D. Readout (Spot Analysis)**
1. Count visible plaques.  
2. Calculate PFU/mL using:  
   PFU/mL = (number of plaques × dilution factor) / volume of phage dilution (mL)  
3. Record plaque morphology (size, clarity).
