###### Purpose
Quantify phage survival and release kinetics following exposure to different pH conditions.

---

###### Materials
- Host culture at OD₆₀₀ = 0.4–0.6
- LB broth, soft/top agar (0.4–0.7%)
- Capsule and free-phage bath samples
- Sterile tubes and tips
- LBa plates (1.5% agar)
- 37 °C incubator

###### Methods
**A. Serial Dilutions**
| Sample Type | Dilution Range |
|--------------|----------------|
| Release (pH 6.8–7.4) | 10⁻⁴ – 10⁻⁷ |
| Release (pH 6.0) | 10⁻³ – 10⁻⁶ |
| Acid-hold | 10⁻² – 10⁻⁵ |
| Free-phage acid | neat – 10⁻² |
| Free-phage neutral | 10⁻⁴ – 10⁻⁶ |

1. Use 180 µL LB per dilution, transfer 20 µL each step.  
2. Mix thoroughly.  

**B. Plating**
1. Mix 100 µL of each dilution with 100 µL host bacteria.  
2. Add to ~5 mL molten top agar (55 °C) and pour.  
3. Solidify (~5 min), incubate inverted at 37 °C overnight.

###### Next Day – Readout
1. Count plates with 30–300 plaques.  
2. Calculate PFU/mL for each condition.  
3. Determine % survival vs input control.  
4. Report:
   - Capsule integrity vs pH (% intact at 120 min).  
   - Median release time (≥ pH 6.0).  
   - PFU survival after release vs free-phage controls.
