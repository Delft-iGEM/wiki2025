###### Experimental Design
- pH conditions: 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 6.8, 7.4  
- Replicates: 3 capsules and 3 free-phage tubes per pH  
- Bath volumes: 10 mL for capsules; 5 mL for free phage  
- Capsule payload: 100 µL T7 stock

###### A. Warm-Up and Tube Setup 
1. Warm all buffer solutions to 37 °C.  
2. Verify pH at 37 °C; adjust if off by > 0.1 unit.  
3. Aliquot buffers:  
   - Capsule baths → 10 mL into 18 tubes.  
   - Free-phage baths → 5 mL into 18 tubes.  
4. Keep tubes at 37 °C.

###### B. Capsule Filling 
1. Work cleanly (near flame or in hood).  
2. On ice, fill 18 capsules with 100 µL T7 stock.  
3. Close firmly and keep chilled until use.
