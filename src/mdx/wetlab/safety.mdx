## safety in the lab
Carrying out our iGEM project required extensive lab work, which made safety a top priority, for both our team and the environment. To ensure this, we consistently followed strict precautions:

#### general lab safety
We always wore protective clothing, including buttoned lab coats, long pants (even in summer), and closed shoes. We used gloves and safety glasses whenever necessary. Before leaving the lab, we removed our lab coats and thoroughly washed and disinfected our hands to prevent the spread of (genetically modified) microorganisms outside the laboratory.

#### gel electrophoresis
For gel electrophoresis, we used _SYBR Safe_, a mutagenic and potentially hazardous dye. To minimize risk, electrophoresis was only carried out in a designated area of the lab under strict safety rules. Gloves were always worn when handling materials in this area, and used gloves were disposed of in a dedicated waste container.

#### SDS-PAGE (protein gels)
SDS-PAGE required working with acrylamide gels, which are both toxic and carcinogenic. We conducted these experiments in a designated workspace, and we wore gloves at all times. We handled hazardous reagents such as SDS-PAGE buffer, reducing agents, and stains exclusively under a fume hood to avoid inhaling toxic vapors.
 
#### working with bacteriophages
To avoid phage contamination, we set up a separate, clearly labeled phage-only area in the lab. In this space, we always wore gloves, disinfected all surfaces and tools with freshly prepared Virkon after each experiment, and used dedicated equipment - including an incubator and filter-tip pipettes - exclusively for phage work.

#### after-hours safety
For evening lab work, we always worked in pairs, ensuring that someone was available to assist immediately in case of an accident.

#### institutional biosafety oversight
Before beginning any work with GMOs or engineered constructs, we submitted a detailed safety protocol to our university’s Biosafety Officer. This ensured that none of the organisms, constructs, or procedures posed risks to us or to the environment.
