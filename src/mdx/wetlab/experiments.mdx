# Experiments: Introduction

To build the **Snaccine** platform, we split our experimental workflow into parallel modules. This modular approach allows us to answer specific scientific questions independently, while also creating interlinked pipelines where progress in one module accelerates development in others. By doing so, we can optimize efficiency, reduce dependencies, and generate reliable data at different stages of **phage engineering, stability testing, VLP production, delivery, and immunogenicity**.  

Each module has a distinct focus:


### **Module A – T7 Genome Engineering**
This module aims to establish an accessible workflow for engineering the genome of the **T7 phage**.  
- **A1 (Phage Training):** We master plaque assays, quantification (PFU/mL), and DNA purification—skills essential for later experiments.  
- **A2 (eGFP Tagging):** We attempt to insert an eGFP reporter into the T7 genome using a novel *in vitro* workflow inspired by recent literature. This demonstrates that genome engineering is possible without compromising infectivity, while also producing fluorescently labeled phages for downstream tracking.

  #### **PCR Primer Design**
  PCR primer sequences for both T7 phage genome production and screening of DNA products were designed with **SnapGene³**.  
  - Primer sequences for Wild Type Assembly were taken from *Levrier et al.*¹  
  - Screening PCR primers were designed with a melting temperature of ~60 °C and a G/C 3’ end, which supports a more stable initiation of DNA replication (*ref. needed*).  
  - To insert the **mCherry** gene into the T7 genome, we designed primer sets that amplified the mCherry insert and flanking T7 genomic fragments with identical overlapping sequences at their ends.  
  - Primers included an **orthogonal homologous sequence (oho)** to minimize unintended homology to the T7 genome.  
  - Primers were ordered dissolved in water (100 μM), then diluted to 10 μM for PCR use.  



  #### **Q5 PCR**
  A modified protocol for **Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix⁵** was used to produce T7 genome assembly fragments (wild-type and mCherry insertion genomes).  
  - Starting DNA: 1 μL of T7 bacteriophage solution (~0.7 PFU/μL) per 50 μL PCR reaction.  
  - Primer and master mix ratios followed NEB guidelines.  
  - **NEB Tm calculator⁴** was used to estimate primer annealing temperatures for PCR cycling design.  

  

  #### **1% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis for DNA**
  Used to verify DNA length.  
  - 1× TAE buffer was used for gel and electrophoresis.  
  - Run: 1 h at 100 V.  
  - **SYBR Safe** for DNA staining and **NEB Purple Gel Loading Dye** for sample loading.  
  - Gels were analyzed after electrophoresis.  

  

  #### **T7 Genome Assembly**
  The **NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Kit⁶** was used to assemble the T7 genome.  
  - Equimolar fragment amounts were calculated using the **NEBuilder Protocol Calculator**.  
  - Fragments: A, B, C, D, Coho1, Coho2, and oho1_mCherry_oho2.  
  - Concentrations and volumes were determined based on DNA measurements (see *Results*).  

  

  #### **Column Precipitation of PCR Products**
  PCR products were purified using the **NEB Monarch Spin PCR Cleanup Kit⁷**, which:  
  1. Binds DNA to a selection column.  
  2. Washes away oligos and enzymes.  
  3. Elutes purified DNA with a specialized buffer.  

  

  #### **Heat Shock Transformation and Phage Reboot**
  A modified **NEB transformation protocol** was used to reboot T7 phages in **BL21(DE3)** cells.  
  - Main change: longer SOC outgrowth followed by transfer to **liquid LB medium** for overnight culture instead of plating.  

  

  #### **Electrocompetent Cell Preparation**
  **BL21(DE3)** cells were made electrocompetent following the **Baricklab protocol¹⁰**.  

  

  #### **Transformation via Electroporation**
  Standard **electroporation** protocol (Baricklab¹⁰) used to reboot T7 phage production.  
  - Main change: longer SOC outgrowth followed by transfer to **liquid LB** medium.  

  

  #### **T7 Phage Filtration**
  Filtration step removes **E. coli** host cells from the rebooted T7 phage solution, ensuring a pure phage stock.  

  

  #### **T7 Phage Concentration**
  Phages were concentrated using a **protein purification filter**, enabling detection even from low-yield productions.  

  

  #### **T7 Phage Plaque Assay**
  Used to test phage presence and quantify concentration.  
  - *E. coli* cells are plated in 0.6% LB agarose.  
  - Phage solution is added.  
  - Empty spots (plaques) indicate phage-induced cell lysis and spread.

### **Module B – Storage & Stability**
In this module, we explore how T7 behaves in environments that mimic **food storage** or the **gastrointestinal tract**.  
- **B1:** Tests viability across conditions of salinity, temperature, and moisture to see if encapsulating the phages is necessary.  
- **B2:** Investigates survival in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, revealing whether protective coatings are required for oral delivery.  
Both depend on plaque assay techniques from Module A1.

### **Module C – VLP Production with Plasmid**
This module tests whether *E. coli* can express and assemble **MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs)** from a synthetic plasmid under T7 promoter control.  
Expression and folding are confirmed by **SDS-PAGE** and **TEM imaging**. Successful results validate our plasmid design and establish a foundation for transferring VLP production into engineered phages.  


  <Dropdown header="VLP Production in bacteria - experiments" level={0}>

  #### **1. Plasmid Design and Construction**
  We engineered a plasmid construct **(pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp)** encoding the MS2 maturase fused to the coat protein under a **T7 promoter**.  
  This construct validates expression of **MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs)** in *E. coli*.  

  **Figure 1.** Plasmid map of our engineered construct (pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp) showing promoter, maturase, coat protein, and MS2 RNA stem loop.  
  **Figure 2.** Linear schematic of the synthetic insert prior to backbone insertion.  

  #### **2. Transformation into BL21(DE3) Cells**
  The construct was introduced into **BL21(DE3)** cells, enabling T7-driven expression.  
  Successful transformants were selected on **kanamycin plates** for downstream studies.  

  #### **3. Protein Expression Induction**
  Cultures were induced with **IPTG** under various concentrations and temperatures.  
  Optimal condition: **0.4 mM IPTG**, **17 °C**, **16 h** — yielding soluble VLP expression and minimal aggregation.  

  #### **4. Harvest and Lysis**
  Cells were harvested and lysed via **sonication**.  
  Soluble **MS2 VLP proteins** were detected in the supernatant; uninduced and pellet fractions showed no expression.  

  #### **5. SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis**
  Induced and uninduced fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE.  
  A **13.7 kDa band** corresponding to the MS2 coat protein was observed, confirming soluble expression.  

  #### **6. PEG Precipitation of VLPs**
  **PEG precipitation** was used to selectively enrich assembled VLPs from soluble fractions, preparing them for structural analysis.  

  #### **7. TEM Imaging**
  Purified particles were imaged using **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** with negative staining.  
  Micrographs revealed **icosahedral VLPs (~27 nm)**, confirming correct assembly.  

  #### **8. TEM Average Projection**
  To obtain an average projection of MS2 VLPs and confirm geometry, we used the **RELION** software package.

### **Module D – VLP Delivery to Mammalian Cells**
VLPs from Module C will be tested for their ability to deliver genetic cargo into **eukaryotic cells**.  
This step will evaluate uptake efficiency and expression, bridging microbial engineering with mammalian immunology.  

---

### **Module AC – Phage/VLP Co-Production**
This integrative module combines Modules A and C by equipping engineered T7 phages with VLP cargo genes.  
The goal is to demonstrate that phage infection can drive bacterial production of VLPs with packaged mRNA, confirming that the two modular strategies can converge into a single workflow.  

---

### **Module E – Immunogenicity Assays**
With purified VLPs (and eventually phage-driven VLPs), we will assess immune responses.  
- **E1:** Investigates whether antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mature upon exposure.  
- **E2:** Examines cytokine and chemokine release, ensuring safety by defining tolerable doses and identifying risks of unwanted inflammation.  

---

### **Module F – Vaccine Extension (Bird Flu Case Study)**
Finally, we apply insights from all modules to design a practical vaccine candidate against **avian influenza**.  
This demonstrates the translational potential of Snaccine beyond proof-of-concept, addressing manufacturability, safety, and immunogenicity.  

By progressing through these modules in parallel, we create a **flexible and scalable experimental platform**.
