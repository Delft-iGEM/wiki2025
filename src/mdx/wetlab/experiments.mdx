experimental design and methodology for our wetlab work
</Header>

<Content items="left">

To build the **Snaccine** platform, we split our experimental workflow into parallel modules. This modular approach allows us to answer specific scientific questions independently, while also creating interlinked pipelines where progress in one module accelerates development in others. By doing so, we can optimize efficiency, reduce dependencies, and generate reliable data at different stages of **phage engineering, stability testing, VLP production, delivery, and immunogenicity**.

Each module has a distinct focus:


### **Module A – T7 Genome Engineering**
Genome engineering of phages is at the core of Snaccine. Thus in this module we explored a novel **in-vitro T7 genome engineering** pipeline to align the aims of producing engineered phages with our goals of accessible and adaptable bird flu vaccine platform. We examined an approach based on **PCR** of T7 genomic fragments and **Genome Assembly** techniques for a **rapid and flexible engineering of phages**. Hence, this technique presents great potential for introducing our engineered MS2 gene together with an antigen mRNA. We successfully produced such phage fragments and attempted to produce an engineered T7 phage genome containing mCherry gene. Furthermore, to analyze phage production has been rebooted we performed **plaque assays** to screen for propagating phages.

  #### **PCR Primer Design**
  PCR primer sequences for both T7 phage genome production and screening of DNA products were designed with **SnapGene³**.  
  - Primer sequences for Wild Type Assembly were taken from *Levrier et al.*¹  
  - Screening PCR primers were designed with a melting temperature of ~60 °C and a G/C 3’ end, which supports a more stable initiation of DNA replication (*ref. needed*).  
  - To insert the **mCherry** gene into the T7 genome, we designed primer sets that amplified the mCherry insert and flanking T7 genomic fragments with identical overlapping sequences at their ends.  
  - Primers included an **orthogonal homologous sequence (oho)** to minimize unintended homology to the T7 genome.  
  - Primers were ordered dissolved in water (100 μM), then diluted to 10 μM for PCR use.  



  #### **Q5 PCR**
  A modified protocol for **Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix⁵** was used to produce T7 genome assembly fragments (wild-type and mCherry insertion genomes).  
  - Starting DNA: 1 μL of T7 bacteriophage solution (~0.7 PFU/μL) per 50 μL PCR reaction.  
  - Primer and master mix ratios followed NEB guidelines.  
  - **NEB Tm calculator⁴** was used to estimate primer annealing temperatures for PCR cycling design.

### **Module B – Storage & Stability**
In this module, we explore how T7 behaves in environments that mimic **food storage** or the **gastrointestinal tract**.  
- **B1:** Tests viability across conditions of temperature for prolonged time to simulate storage.  
- **B2:** Investigates survival in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, revealing whether protective coatings are required for oral delivery.  
Both depend on plaque assay techniques from Module A1.  

<Dropdown header="Phage storage and stability testing" level={0}>

  #### **1. Long-Term Temperature Stability**
  To simulate **food storage environments**, we evaluated how T7 phages remain viable when stored at different temperatures for several weeks.  
  - **Conditions tested:** 4 °C (refrigeration), ~20 °C (room temperature), and 37 °C (body temperature).  
  - Each week, fresh samples were incubated at these temperatures for up to **4 weeks**, followed by **plaque assay quantification** to determine residual infectivity.  
  - This experiment reveals the optimal storage temperature and expected shelf life of T7-based products.  


  #### **2. Preparation of Simulated Gastric and Intestinal Baths**
  To mimic **gastrointestinal environments**, we prepared a series of **acidic (pH 1.5–3.0)** and **neutral/basic (pH 6.0–7.4)** buffer systems.  
  - Acidic buffers were made using **NaCl** and **HCl** to reproduce stomach-like conditions.  
  - Neutral and basic phosphate buffers simulated intestinal fluids.  
  - All solutions were equilibrated to **37 °C** prior to testing.  
  These prepared baths formed the basis for subsequent pH stability assays.  


  #### **3. Capsule and Free-Phage pH Stability Test**
  Using the prepared pH baths, we assessed the protective potential of **encapsulation** versus **free phage exposure**.  
  - Each pH condition (1.5–7.4) included **triplicate capsules** containing 100 µL of T7 stock and **triplicate free-phage controls**.  
  - Capsules and free phages were incubated at **37 °C** to replicate physiological conditions.  
  - At defined time points, samples were collected for **plaque assay** analysis to quantify surviving phages.  
  This experiment models the digestive journey of orally delivered phages.  


  #### **4. Plaque Assay Analysis**
  Stability across conditions was quantified using the **double-agar overlay plaque assay**.  
  - Phage titers (PFU/mL) were measured for both capsule and free-phage samples.  
  - Results were expressed as **percent survival relative to input controls**, allowing direct comparison between storage and gastrointestinal simulations.  
  - Key outcomes included capsule integrity, median release time, and phage survival efficiency.

### **Module D – VLP Delivery to Mammalian Cells**
VLPs from Module C will be tested for their ability to deliver genetic cargo into **eukaryotic cells**.  
This step will evaluate uptake efficiency and expression, bridging microbial engineering with mammalian immunology.

### **Module AC – Phage/VLP Co-Production**
This integrative module combines Modules A and C by equipping engineered T7 phages with VLP cargo genes.  
The goal is to demonstrate that phage infection can drive bacterial production of VLPs with packaged mRNA, confirming that the two modular strategies can converge into a single workflow.

### **Module E – Immunogenicity Assays**
With purified VLPs (and eventually phage-driven VLPs), we will assess immune responses.  
- **E1:** Investigates whether antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mature upon exposure.  
- **E2:** Examines cytokine and chemokine release, ensuring safety by defining tolerable doses and identifying risks of unwanted inflammation.

### **Module F – Vaccine Extension (Bird Flu Case Study)**
Finally, we apply insights from all modules to design a practical vaccine candidate against **avian influenza**.  
This demonstrates the translational potential of Snaccine beyond proof-of-concept, addressing manufacturability, safety, and immunogenicity.  

By progressing through these modules in parallel, we create a **flexible and scalable experimental platform**.
