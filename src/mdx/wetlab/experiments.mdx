# Experiment Design: Introduction

To build the **Snaccine** platform, we split our experimental workflow into **parallel modules**. This modular approach allows us to answer specific scientific questions independently, while also creating interlinked pipelines where progress in one module accelerates development in others. By doing so, we can optimize efficiency, reduce dependencies, and generate reliable data at different stages of **phage engineering, stability testing, VLP production, delivery, and immunogenicity**.

Each module has a distinct focus:

---

## Module A – T7 Engineering via PHEIGES

Here we establish the foundations of working with bacteriophage **T7**.  
- **A1 (Phage Training):** master plaque assays, quantification (**PFU/mL**), and DNA purification—skills essential for later experiments.  
- **A2 (eGFP Tagging):** insert an **eGFP** reporter into the T7 genome using the **PHEIGES** workflow. This demonstrates that genome engineering is possible without compromising infectivity, while also producing fluorescently labeled phages for downstream tracking.

---

## Module B – Storage & Stability

Explore how **T7** behaves in environments that mimic food storage and the gastrointestinal tract.  
- **B1:** test viability across **salinity, temperature, and moisture** to see if encapsulation is necessary.  
- **B2:** investigate survival in **simulated gastric and intestinal fluids**, revealing whether protective coatings are required for oral delivery.  
Both depend on plaque assay techniques from **Module A1**.

---

## Module C – VLP Production with Plasmid

Test whether **_E. coli_** can express and assemble **MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs)** from a synthetic plasmid under **T7 promoter** control. Expression and folding are confirmed by **SDS-PAGE** and **TEM** imaging. Successful results validate our plasmid design and establish a foundation for transferring VLP production into engineered phages.

---

## Module D – VLP Delivery to Mammalian Cells

VLPs from **Module C** are tested for their ability to **deliver genetic cargo into eukaryotic cells**. This step evaluates uptake efficiency and expression, bridging microbial engineering with mammalian immunology.

---

## Module AC – Phage/VLP Co-Production

Combine **Modules A and C** by equipping engineered **T7** phages with **VLP cargo genes**. The goal is to demonstrate that **phage infection** can drive bacterial production of VLPs with packaged mRNA, confirming that the two modular strategies can converge into a single workflow.

---

## Module E – Immunogenicity Assays

With purified VLPs (and eventually phage-driven VLPs), assess immune responses.  
- **E1:** do APC maturation assays upon exposure.  
- **E2:** examine **cytokine/chemokine release**, ensuring safety by defining tolerable doses and identifying risks of unwanted inflammation.

---

## Module F – Vaccine Extension (Bird Flu Case Study)

Apply insights from all modules to design a practical **avian influenza** vaccine candidate. This demonstrates the translational potential of Snaccine beyond proof-of-concept, while addressing **manufacturability, safety, and immunogenicity**.

---

By progressing through these modules in parallel, we created a **flexible and scalable experimental platform**. Each module generated independent insights while also feeding into the broader Snaccine pipeline—from **phage engineering** to **real-world vaccine applications**.

# Module A

## Keywords
- **PCR**
- **Gibson Assembly**
- **BL21 _E. coli_ transformation**
- **mCherry**

## General goal of the module (for Project Description section)

### Link to motivation for the project
Phage engineering has a long history and remains challenging. Most methods rely on **homologous recombination**, which can be inefficient and difficult.

**For the aim of the project, we need to:**
- Show we can **engineer phages**.  
- Demonstrate **functional insertions** of a gene of interest.  
- Establish freedom to add **larger constructs** into the phage genome, reflecting bigger antigen size and potential regulatory factors.

### Link to previous iGEM projects aims
We build on prior work—**Phocus** and **Phaccine**—as prime inspirations.

**What we took from them**
- Identification of **two insertion sites** for gene integration.  
- Refined via research on **PHEIGES**; consultation with **Rita (SB Lab)** suggested **Gibson Assembly** with a modified transformation protocol to engineer phages.

## Results (for Project Results section)
- **Fragment production:** PCR of T7 → gel.  
- **Assembly with GA:** PCR analysis, sequencing, and plaque assay.  
- **Functionality of mini vs. WT.**  
- **Functionality of mCherry-inserted constructs.**  
- **Confirmation of mCherry fluorescence.**

# Module B
_To be added…_

---

# Module C
_*Idea: make each step clickable to reveal a detailed explanation/results._

## Introduction to Module C
To validate our vaccine platform design, we first needed to demonstrate that **_E. coli_** can express **MS2 VLPs** from a synthetic plasmid construct. This plasmid encodes a **fusion of the MS2 maturase (A protein) and coat protein** under control of a **T7 promoter**. Ultimately, this design will be **integrated into the genome** of our engineered bacteriophage for vaccine production in the gut. Before that, we established a **proof-of-concept** in a standard _E. coli_ expression system.

**Figure 2.** Linear schematic of the synthetic insert (promoter, maturase, MS2 coat protein, RNA loop) before insertion into the plasmid backbone.

---

## 2. Transformation into BL21(DE3) Cells
We chose **BL21(DE3)** as host because they carry **T7 RNA polymerase** under **lacUV5** control, enabling high-level expression upon **IPTG** induction.

The plasmid **pET-MS2 (Kan^R)** was introduced via **heat-shock transformation**. Transformants were selected on **LB + kanamycin** plates. Colonies were picked for **overnight cultures** and downstream expression.

---

## 3. Overnight Culture and Protein Expression Induction
- Single colony → **LB + kanamycin**, **16 h**, **37 °C**.  
- Plasmid miniprep → **sequencing** to confirm integrity.  
- Dilute **1:50** into fresh LB + Kan, grow to **OD₆₀₀ ≈ 0.4–0.6**.  
- Induce with **IPTG** under multiple conditions.

**Table 2. Proposed Induction Conditions (example for MS2 CP–A fusion)**

| Culture ID | IPTG Conc. (mM) | Induction Temp (°C) | Induction Time | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| NC (no IPTG) | 0 | 37 | 4 h | Negative control |
| standard | 0.5 | 37 | 4 h (OD ~2–3) | Positive control |
| 1 | 0.1 | 37 | 4 h | Lower inducer (folding test) |
| 2 | 1.0 | 37 | 4 h | High inducer (max expression) |
| 3 | 0.5 | 30 | 6 h | Lower temp |
| 4 | 0.5 | 18 | ~16 h (ON) | Low temp, overnight |

**Chosen condition (expert-guided):** **0.4 mM IPTG**, **17 °C**, **16 h (overnight)** to favor soluble, correctly folded VLP proteins.

---

## 4. Harvest and Lysis
- Harvest induced & control cultures; resuspend in **NaNO₃ + PMSF**.  
- Initial lysis: **lysozyme + sonication** → **confounded SDS-PAGE** (lysozyme band ~40 kDa overlapped signals).  
- Revised lysis: **sonication-only** → clear detection of **MS2 VLP** band in **induced supernatant** (absent in controls/pellet).  
- Conclusion: successful **soluble expression** suitable for PEG precipitation & **TEM**.

---

## 5. SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis
- Analyze **total lysate**, **supernatant**, **pellet**; normalize by **Bradford**.  
- Target band: **MS2 coat protein ~13.7 kDa**.  
- Result: **distinct 13.7 kDa band** in **induced supernatant only** → majority of protein is **soluble**, supporting proper folding/assembly.

---

## 6. PEG Precipitation of VLPs
- Apply **PEG** to clarified supernatant to **concentrate/enrich** VLPs.  
- Collect precipitate by **centrifugation**; resuspend in buffer.  
- Outcome: visible **protein pellet** consistent with VLP enrichment → ready for **TEM** analysis.

---

## 7. TEM Imaging
Confirm assembly via **Transmission Electron Microscopy**:

- Grid: **carbon-coated copper**, **negative stain** (e.g., uranyl acetate).  
- Expect **spherical/icosahedral** particles, **~27 nm** diameter.  
- Direct visualization of morphology validates correct **VLP assembly**.

these modules in parallel, we create a **flexible and scalable experimental platform**. Each module generates independent insights while also feeding into the broader Snaccine pipeline - from phage engineering to real-world vaccine applications.
