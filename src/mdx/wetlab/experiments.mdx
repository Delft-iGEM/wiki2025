## Introduction

To build the **Snaccine platform**, we split our experimental workflow into parallel modules. This modular approach allows us to answer specific scientific questions independently, while also creating interlinked pipelines where progress in one module accelerates development in others. By doing so, we can optimize efficiency, reduce dependencies, and generate reliable data at different stages of phage engineering, stability testing, VLP production, delivery, and immunogenicity. 

### Module A – T7 Engineering via PHEIGES
Here we establish the foundations of working with bacteriophage T7.  

- **A1 (Phage Training):** Master plaque assays, quantification (PFU/mL), and DNA purification—skills essential for later experiments.  
- **A2 (eGFP Tagging):** Insert an eGFP reporter into the T7 genome using the PHEIGES workflow. This demonstrates that genome engineering is possible without compromising infectivity, while also producing fluorescently labeled phages for downstream tracking.

### Module B – Storage & Stability
This module explores how T7 behaves in environments that mimic food storage and the gastrointestinal tract.  

- **B1:** Test viability across conditions of salinity, temperature, and moisture to see if encapsulation is necessary.  
- **B2:** Investigate survival in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, revealing whether protective coatings are required for oral delivery.  

*Both depend on plaque assay techniques from Module A1.*

### Module C – VLP Production with Plasmid
Test whether *E. coli* can express and assemble MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) from a synthetic plasmid under T7 promoter control.  

- Confirm expression and folding via **SDS-PAGE** and **TEM imaging**.  
- Successful results validate plasmid design and establish a foundation for transferring VLP production into engineered phages.

    ##### Validation of Vaccine Platform Design

    To validate our vaccine platform design, we first needed to demonstrate that *E. coli* can express MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) from a synthetic plasmid construct.  
    This plasmid encodes a fusion of the **MS2 maturase (A protein)** and **coat protein** under control of a **T7 promoter**.  

    Ultimately, this design will be integrated into the genome of our engineered bacteriophage for vaccine production in the gut.  
    However, before taking this step, it was essential to establish a proof-of-concept: that the genetic design is functional in a standard *E. coli* expression system.

    **Figure 1.** Plasmid map of our engineered construct (**pET-Kan-T7lac-mat-MS2cp**) containing the promoter, maturase gene, MS2 coat protein, and MS2 RNA stem loop.  

    **Figure 2.** Linear schematic of the synthetic insert we designed, showing the promoter, maturase, MS2 coat protein, and RNA loop before insertion into the plasmid backbone.

    #### 2. Transformation into BL21(DE3) Cells

    - **Host choice:** BL21(DE3) cells carry the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the lacUV5 promoter, enabling strong expression with IPTG induction.  
    - **Method:** Heat shock transformation. Competent *E. coli* cells were briefly exposed to a temperature shock to allow plasmid entry.  
    - **Selection:** Cells were plated on **LB + kanamycin**, ensuring only plasmid-bearing colonies survived.  
    - **Outcome:** Colonies were picked for overnight culture and subsequent protein expression.  

    ---

    #### 3. Overnight Culture and Protein Expression Induction

    - Single colony grown overnight in **LB + kanamycin** (16 h, 37 °C).  
    - Plasmid DNA isolated and sequenced to confirm construct integrity.  
    - Culture diluted 1:50 into fresh LB + kanamycin until **OD₆₀₀ ≈ 0.4–0.6**.  
    - **Protein expression induced with IPTG.**

    #### Table 2. Proposed Induction Conditions for MS2 CP–A Fusion

    | Culture ID | IPTG Conc. (mM) | Temp (°C) | Induction Time | Notes |
    |------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
    | NC (no IPTG) | 0.0 | 37 | 4 h | Negative control |
    | Standard | 0.5 | 37 | 4 h | Positive control |
    | 1 | 0.1 | 37 | 4 h | Lower inducer (test folding) |
    | 2 | 1.0 | 37 | 4 h | High inducer |
    | 3 | 0.5 | 30 | 6 h | Moderate IPTG, lower temp |
    | 4 | 0.5 | 18 | ~16 h | Overnight induction |

    **Chosen condition (Suggested by an expert):** *0.4 mM IPTG, 17 °C, 16 h (overnight).*  
    This slower expression strategy reduced aggregation and improved folding.

    #### 4. Harvest and Lysis

    - Cultures (induced + uninduced) harvested by centrifugation.  
    - Cells resuspended in **NaNO₃ + PMSF** buffer.  
    - Initial lysis with lysozyme + sonication → false-positive band (~40 kDa) from lysozyme.  
    - Revised method: **sonication only** → clear detection of MS2 VLP proteins in the induced supernatant, absent in controls.  

    ---

    #### 5. SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis

    - Samples: total lysate, supernatant (soluble), pellet (insoluble).  
    - Normalized protein concentrations via **Bradford assay**.  
    - **Expected band:** 13.7 kDa (MS2 coat protein).  
    - Results: clear band at 13.7 kDa in **induced supernatant only**, showing soluble protein expression.  

    ---

    #### 6. PEG Precipitation of VLPs

    - PEG used to precipitate and enrich assembled VLPs from supernatant.  
    - Centrifugation yielded visible protein pellet enriched in capsids.  
    - Pellet resuspended in buffer for downstream analysis.  

    ---

    #### 7. TEM Imaging

    - Samples from PEG-precipitated supernatant prepared on carbon-coated copper grids.  
    - Negative staining with uranyl acetate for contrast.  
    - TEM confirmed **spherical/icosahedral VLPs (~27 nm diameter)**, consistent with correctly assembled MS2 particles.

### Module D – VLP Delivery to Mammalian Cells
VLPs from Module C are tested for their ability to deliver genetic cargo into eukaryotic cells.  

- Evaluate uptake efficiency and expression.  
- Bridge microbial engineering with mammalian immunology.

### Module A+C – Phage/VLP Co-Production
This integrative module combines Modules A and C by equipping engineered T7 phages with VLP cargo genes.  

- Demonstrate that phage infection can drive bacterial production of VLPs with packaged mRNA.  
- Confirm that the two modular strategies converge into a single workflow.  


### Module E – Immunogenicity Assays
With purified VLPs (and eventually phage-driven VLPs), we assess immune responses.  

- **E1:** Investigate whether antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mature upon exposure.  
- **E2:** Examine cytokine and chemokine release, ensuring safety by defining tolerable doses and identifying risks of unwanted inflammation.

By progressing through these modules in parallel, we create a **flexible and scalable experimental platform**. Each module generates independent insights while also feeding into the broader Snaccine pipeline - from phage engineering to real-world vaccine applications.
