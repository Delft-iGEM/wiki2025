## Introduction
To build the Snaccine platform, we split our experimental workflow into parallel modules. This modular approach allows us to answer specific scientific questions independently, while also creating interlinked pipelines where progress in one module accelerates development in others. By doing so, we can optimize efficiency, reduce dependencies, and generate reliable data at different stages of phage engineering, stability testing, VLP production, delivery, and immunogenicity.
