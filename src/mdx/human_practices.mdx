## What is (integrated) Human Practices in relation to Snaccine? 

### “Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.” – Peter Carr, iGEM (as cited in Whitford et al., 2018, p. 986) 

For Snaccine, Human Practices means designing with accountability to the real world. This principle guided our project choice and continues to shape our design through ongoing, integrated Human Practices cycles. 

We began by analysing the challenges posed by avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, and its current countermeasures. To ground our approach in Responsible Research and Innovation (Stilgoe et al., 2013), we applied two complementary frameworks. First, under Safe-by-Design, we anticipated risks of our technology and their likelihood to create containment plans. Second, under Value Sensitive Design, we identified our stakeholders and mapped their values and concerns to the specific context of our project. 

This Human Practices section lays our foundational groundwork, addressing the first half of the iGEM ethos: understanding how our work affects the world. It presents the theoretical frameworks of Responsible Research and Innovation, Safe-by-Design, and Value Sensitive Design that guided our project. 

The following Integrated Human Practices section completes this cycle by documenting the crucial second half: how the world affects our work. It shows how we acted on our foundation by engaging stakeholders and translating their insights into pivotal design changes and actionable plans.

## INTRODUCTION 

### 1. The Scale of the HPAI Crisis 

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) circulates in Europe year-round, with peak activity from November to February due to the migration and overwintering of wild birds. Long-term data show that outbreaks in both wild and domestic birds are persistent and follow concrete yearly patterns (Opata et al., 2025). 

The latest quarterly report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) compiles surveillance data. In the current epidemiological year (Oct 2024 – June 2025), 598 HPAI cases in poultry and 1,264 in wild birds have been reported across 24 European countries, predominantly of the H5N1 strain. During March–June 2025, 85% of EU poultry outbreaks occurred in Hungary and Poland, clustered in high-production regions where EFSA identified secondary spread as the key driver. At the same time, zoonotic spillovers, with cases in foxes, otters, and even a first-ever detection in sheep in the UK, highlight the virus's potential to cross species barriers (EFSA & ECDC, 2025). While molecular analyses show the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low for the general public, it is low-to-moderate for people with occupational exposure, like farmers and veterinarians. Among others, these are directly affected stakeholders and end-users of Snaccine. 

### 2. Current Control Measures: An Untenable Trade-Off 

European outbreak control against HPAI currently relies on culling and establishing strict movement-control zones. Between March and June 2025, approximately 8 million birds were culled in response to only 365 detections (EFSA, ECDC, & EURL, 2025). Independent modeling shows a consistent trade-off: pre-emptive culling can shorten an outbreak but increases the number of farms depopulated, while emergency vaccination may save birds but prolong the outbreak's duration (Backer et al., 2015). With similar overall costs, the decision is no longer a simple economic choice but a trade-off between animal welfare, logistics, and the speed of ending the outbreak. Therefore, our HP focus is on finding a preventive solution. 

### 3. The Vaccine Gap: Why Existing Technology Isn't the Answer 

While vaccination is an existing alternative to culling, current options don't fully solve the HPAI problem. A 2023 EFSA vaccination assessment pointed out a critical flaw: their inability to be fully efficacious in stopping virus transmission. Since then, two new vaccines have been authorized EU-wide. However, both are based on the same Herpesvirus of Turkey (HVT) vector technology and face the same limitations. 

First, current vaccines are administered in ovo (to the egg in the hatchery) or subcutaneously (by injection) to one-day-old chicks, making mass application during an emergency impractical. Second, data on how long immunity lasts is often incomplete. Most importantly, the live HVT vector platform requires constant updating to keep pace with the virus's evolution, and minimize antigenic distance, an costly and inefficient process. Therefore, vaccinations have not met EFSA's 2023 criteria yet. 

### 4. Our Solution: Bridging the Gap with the Snaccine Platform 

To address these gaps, we propose **Snaccine**. An ideal vaccine should be: 

- Transmission-blocking  
- Rapidly updatable to counter new strains  
- Suitable for mass application  
- Practical for distribution without a constant cold chain  

Snaccine is designed to meet these needs through its modular design, compatibility with oral delivery, and rapid redesign capabilities. 

Introducing a novel GMO-based platform like Snaccine requires navigating a complex landscape of scientific, regulatory, and social challenges. To ensure our project is grounded in real-world needs and responsibilities, we built our strategy around a deep engagement with the key stakeholders.

## OUR METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 

From the start, our project was guided by a clear philosophy of responsible innovation. To put this philosophy into practice, we integrated two key methodologies: **Value Sensitive Design** to align our project with human values, and **Safe-by-Design** to proactively manage its risks. This section outlines the theoretical groundwork that formed our stakeholder engagement. 

### 1. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI): Our Guiding Philosophy 

> “Responsible innovation means taking care of the future through collective stewardship of science and innovation in the present”  
> (Stilgoe et al., 2013, p. 1570) 

Our project is grounded in the four pillars of RRI: **anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness** (Stilgoe et al., 2013). These principles guided us by continuously questioning:  
*Are we looking far enough ahead? Are we challenging our own biases? Have we included the right voices? And are we prepared to change course based on what we learn?*  

To translate these principles from theory into practice, we mapped each pillar to a core aspect of our project:  

- **Anticipation** — proactively identifying real-world hurdles. Our assessment of risk in SbD became the primary source for this, addressing critical biosafety issues like environmental shedding (RIVM), potential impacts on the farm microbiome, and international trade acceptance (AVINED).  
- **Reflexivity** — critically questioning our assumptions. We asked whether our technical definition of “effectiveness” aligned with the realities of farmers (Johannis Florid), guiding stakeholder mapping and multi-perspective evaluation.  
- **Inclusion** — engaging a broad range of stakeholders. We involved farmers and veterinarians in Human Practices (Johannis Florid, AVINED, Eline Kamerik), ensuring end-user perspectives weren’t overshadowed by regulatory voices.  
- **Responsiveness** — integrating stakeholder feedback to adapt Snaccine in alignment with real needs.  

### 2. Value Sensitive Design (VSD): Aligning Technology with Human Values 

VSD proactively incorporates human values into technology design. Our process began with a deep analysis of the HPAI crisis and current countermeasures, identifying key gaps where Snaccine could provide value.  

**Stakeholder values included:**  

- **Farmers** – animal welfare, autonomy, and market access  
- **Regulators** – public health, biosafety, environmental protection  
- **Poultry industry** – economic viability, cost-efficiency, scalability  
- **Public** – food safety, transparency, sustainability  

Engagement was structured to ensure early, high-quality participation (Rowe & Frewer, 2000).  

### 3. Safe-by-Design (SbD): Designing for Responsibility Under Uncertainty 

Snaccine, as a GMO intended for environmental deployment, required a strong safety framework. We adopted **van de Poel and Robaey’s (2017)** concept of shared responsibility, distributing it across all actors.  

We addressed **five uncertainty types**:  

1. **Risk (Known Unknowns):** predictable hazards like phage shedding and non-target exposure. Mitigations include animal containment, waste inactivation, and comparative ERA vs. HVT vaccines.  
2. **Scenario Uncertainty (Unknown Probabilities):** possible containment escape; mitigated via multiple safety barriers (gut-restricted phage activity).  
3. **Ignorance (Unknown Unknowns):** unpredictable outcomes such as recombination or HGT; mitigated by non-replicative lytic phages.  
4. **Indeterminacy (Human Action):** dependent on user behavior; mitigated by shared responsibility and clear instructional design (pictograms, dosing scoops).  
5. **Normative Ambiguity (Value Conflicts):** balancing animal welfare vs. productivity; managed via transparent documentation of trade-offs and governance conditions.

## Stakeholder Engagement: An Integrated Approach 

### Upstream Engagement: Navigating Regulation and Refining Science 

The regulatory landscape for Snaccine overlaps with:  

- **VMP Regulation (EU 2019/6)** – defines Snaccine as a “Novel Therapy.”  
- **Phage Therapy Guideline** – adapted for delivery-focused, not therapeutic, phages.  
- **mRNA Vaccine Principles** – adapted for in-situ production.  
- **GMO Directive** – requires Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA).  

We consulted:  

- **Prof. Dr. Stan J. J. Brouns** – guided host/phage selection (E. coli, T7/MS2).  
- **RIVM GMO Office** – identified phage shedding as key hazard; advised comparative ERA vs. HVT.  
- **Dr. ir. Luuk van Oosten** – advised on GMP and scale-up variability.  
- **Avian Influenza Field Test Experts** – informed antigen selection (HA-only mRNA) to enable DIVA compatibility.  

### Midstream Engagement: Addressing Economic and Practical Realities 

- **AVINED (Erik de Jonge):** highlighted trade as the major barrier (“90% of the vaccination hurdle”).  
- **Eline Kamerik (Veterinarian):** confirmed oral administration via water as standard; advised on dosing consistency.  

### Downstream Engagement: Designing for the End-User and the Public 

- **Johannis Florid (Farmer):** advised powder format and simple, pictogram-based instructions.  
- **Charlotte Koster (Science Communicator):** guided public outreach using storytelling and two-way communication, focusing on the “undecided” public.

## STAKEHOLDER MAPPING AND ENGAGEMENT 

### A. Upstream Stakeholders (Policy, Regulation, and High-Level Science) 

Context: navigating overlapping EU frameworks on GMOs, veterinary medicines, and One-Health safety assessments.  
Main concerns: **biosafety**, **GMO risk**, and **regulatory uncertainty** due to Snaccine’s hybrid identity (phage + GMO + mRNA).  

Frameworks include:  
- **VMP Regulation (EU) 2019/6** (European Parliament & Council, 2019)  
- **Phage Therapy Guideline** (EMA, 2023)  
- **mRNA Vaccine Principles** (EMA, 2025)  
- **GMO Directive**  

Key insight: progress requires **continuous regulator dialogue**, not just compliance.  

### B. Midstream Stakeholders (Industry, Production, and Implementation) 

Focus: **trade and market acceptance**, and **integration of DIVA surveillance**.  
Challenges:  
- Trade restrictions on vaccinated products (e.g., France’s duck vaccination).  
- High costs of additional surveillance (weekly testing, vet visits).  

### C. Downstream Stakeholders (End-Users and the Public) 

End-users: **farmers**, **food producers**, **consumers**.  
Key acceptance factors:  

- **Practicality:** feed/water-based application preferred over injections.  
- **Trust:** farmers rely on veterinarians and peers.  
- **Communication:** transparent, simple leaflets with clear guidance.  
- **Public Perception:** address GMO sensitivities through clear, balanced outreach.
