## **Integrated Human Practices Introduction**



**"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."** <br/>
**– Peter Carr, iGEM (as cited in Whitford et al., 2018, p. 986)**

Our previous human practice part addressed the first part of shaping Snaccine: **understanding how our work affects the world**. 

Make sure to read it first, to get insights on the theoretical research behind our stakeholder engagement.

This Integrated Human Practices section is the story of the second, crucial part: **how the world affects our work**. It documents how we moved from analysis to action, translating stakeholder insights into meaningful changes.

Our project's development was an iterative cycle of design, consultation, and adaptation. Therewith, we have addressed the second part of our cycle:

<Dropdown header="Stakeholder Engagement" level={0}>

#### **1. Upstream Engagement: Navigating Regulation and Refining Science**

Our engagement began at the foundational level with **Prof. Dr. Stan J. J. Brouns**, an expert in phage-host interactions. We initially had broad ideas for our oral vaccine. His guidance was crucial; he highlighted the importance of using a bacterial host tailored to the gut and working with established display systems. This conversation moved our project from a general concept to a concrete plan. We settled on using the well-established _E. coli_ host and the T7 and MS2 display phages, to ensure our experimental plans were feasible.

With a viable scientific plan, we turned to regulatory and manufacturing hurdles. A consultation with the **Dutch GMO Office at RIVM** provided critical clarity. They confirmed our entire product would be regulated as a single GMO and identified environmental shedding of phages as the primary hazard that we needed to address. In direct response to this, we pivoted our Safe-by-Design principles to prioritize the use of host-specific and non-replicative bacteriophages to minimize environmental shedding. Furthermore, they advised us to benchmark our novel technology against an approved product by using an existing Herpesvirus of Turkey (HVT) vaccine as a foundation for a comparative Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) .

To translate our lab-scale concept into a viable product, we consulted **Dr. ir. Luuk van Oosten**, a Quality Control Scientist and QC CMC lead at Batavia Bioscience. He introduced us to the complexities of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), genetic stability, and scale-up variability. His input prompted us to outline a specific downstream purification process to ensure product purity, particularly focusing on removing endotoxins.

Finally, engagement with **Avian Influenza Field Test Experts** directly impacted our vaccine's design for practical surveillance. They explained the challenges of real-world HPAI vaccination and their interactions with farmers. Based on their feedback, we strategically designed our mRNA to express only the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein. This crucial decision ensures that Snaccine is compatible with existing ELISA and PCR surveillance methods, allowing it to fit into the DIVA (**D**ifferentiating **I**nfected from **V**accinated **A**nimals) diagnostic framework.

#### **2. Midstream Engagement: Addressing Economic and Practical Realities**

Bridging the gap between regulation and on-the-ground application are midstream stakeholders, whose perspectives are dominated by economic viability and practical implementation.

Our discussions with **Erik de Jonge of AVINED**, the Dutch national trade organization for the poultry sector showed us that international trade is a crucial bottleneck. He estimated that trade concerns account for "90% of the vaccination hurdle," a point underscored by the trade restrictions France faced after starting its own duck vaccination program. He also highlighted the significant financial and logistical pressure of DIVA surveillance for vaccinated flocks, which includes weekly testing and monthly veterinarian visits. This stark feedback grounded our project in the reality that technical efficacy is irrelevant without market acceptance.

Moreover, we consulted with **Eline Kamerik**, a veterinarian experienced in the poultry sector, to ensure our administration method aligned with field practices. She validated our core design choice, confirming that oral administration via drinking water is the preferred and most practical standard for poultry because it is scalable and the chicken gut is effective at absorbing vaccines. However, she also pointed out that achieving a reliable and homogenous dose is far easier in water than in feed. This led us to a new challenge: we should either prove the effectiveness of mixing Snaccine into feed or adapt the formulation for water-based delivery to ensure a consistent flock-wide result.

#### **3. Downstream Engagement: Designing for the End-User and the Public**

The ultimate success of Snaccine depends on its acceptance by farmers, food producers, and the public. Our engagement with these downstream stakeholders directly shaped the product's final form and our communication strategy.

Our most direct end-user feedback came from **Johannis Florid**, a farmer managing a mixed flock. His input was simple and transformative. He told us a pill format was impractical because birds would crush it. Instead, a "powder or mix-in format for feed or water would be far more practical". He also emphasized his need for simple, clear instructions on a leaflet specifying the dose, mixing instructions, and side effects. This consultation directly shaped the end-user aspects of our project. We discuss feed and water administration, and its results for formulation and biocontainment in the Iteration Loop 5 of our iHP section.

Johannis also pointed us to the trust and information chain. He relies on his veterinarian and fellow farmers for advice, not "government authorities or complex scientific reports". This reinforced our plan to disseminate information through trusted channels, such as veterinary endorsements, to build credibility.

To address public perception and ensure our message was clear and accessible, we consulted with science communicator **Dr. Charlotte Koster**. She advised us to frame Snaccine within a clear storytelling arc and to segment our audience, focusing our efforts on providing "proper information" to the large, undecided group of the public that is open to hearing both the pros and cons. She also recommended a two-way communication approach. Taking her advice, we implemented an iterative feedback loop to test public perception. We interviewed 12 members of the general public from diverse backgrounds about their views on Snaccine and what questions it raised. We collected those questions and provide clear answers in the Iteration Loop 6 of our iHP section.

## **Design Pivots**

Our project evolved through a series of critical design pivots, driven by integrating feedback from multiple sources.

<Dropdown header="Integration Loop 1: Scientific Feasibility" level={0} >

Our project began with an ambitious vision: to create an oral mRNA vaccination platform using bacteriophages to overcome the limitations of current vaccines. First, we needed to draw up a plan for scientific feasibility.

Our collaboration with Prof. Stan Brouns, provided this blueprint.

- **Chassis Selection:** Prof. Brouns recommended using the T7 bacteriophage, a well-characterized and robust tool for genetic engineering, with _E. coli_ as the host.

- **Core Mechanism:** To ensure the mRNA vaccine was packaged reliably, he recommended the proven biological system of the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MS2-CP) and its corresponding RNA hairpin loop. By engineering the T7 phage to co-express the MS2 capsids and designing our mRNA with the hairpin signal, we could leverage a well-documented mechanism for efficient encapsulation.

**Pivotal Change:** <br/>
With these components defined, we could outline an achievable proof-of-concept: demonstrating that our engineered T7 phage could lyse the _E. coli_ host and produce detectable quantities of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). Our results of this can be seen in the [Wet Lab documentation of Module A and Module C](https://2025.igem.wiki/tu-delft/experiments). This foundational loop transformed the project from a vague ambition into an actionable experimental strategy, making all subsequent work possible.
<DownstreamPurificationFlow />
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown header="Integration Loop 2: Biocontainment" level={0}>

Our initial design featured a replicative lytic phage system, which offered the advantage of high efficacy from a single, small dose through amplification in the gut. While potent, this approach raised significant biosafety questions that became the focus of a major design pivot.

A consultation with the GMO Office at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) reshaped our approach. The experts' primary concerns were:

- **Environmental Shedding:** RIVM clarified that our entire system (the engineered T7 phage, the _E. coli_ host, and the resulting mRNA-loaded VLPs) would be regulated as a single GMO. The key drawback of our replicative design was that biologically active phages would be continuously shed into the environment. Shedding primarily occurs from the manure, which includes traces of Snaccine, and will be spread through wind, water and other animals.<br/><br/>
- **Regulatory Burden:** This persistence would require a complex Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) from administration to manure. For field trials, this would necessitate impractical biocontainment measures like absolute containment of the animals, and their side products, and a destroy all policy after completing the field trial.<br/>

Confronted with this feedback, we weighed the trade-off between the single-dose efficiency of a replicative system and the superior biosafety of a non-replicative alternative. RIVM experts directly suggested a non-replicative phage that produces VLPs but cannot replicate itself as a better containment strategy. This design releases essential concerns of the replicative phage.

**Pivotal Change:** ,<br/> 
After careful deliberation, our team prioritized the non-replicative phage system. This pivot, however, presented the new engineering challenge of delivering a therapeutic dose without the benefit of in-situ amplification. To address the dosage challenge, we will implement multiple administrations to ensure efficacy.

Therefore, we concluded that the benefits of inherent biocontainment, and the proactive mitigation of ecological risks were essential for responsible innovation.
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown header="Integration Loop 3: DIVA-Compatibility" level={0}>

Initially, our project aimed to deliver a generic mRNA vaccine for Avian Influenza (AI). Through consultations with experts we discovered that the specific content of the mRNA payload was critical for adoption. The feedback from three distinct stakeholder groups converged on a single, elegant solution .

- **The Practical Challenge:** Field trial experts raised the issue of surveillance. For any HPAI vaccination program to be viable, authorities must be able to **D**ifferentiate **I**nfected from **V**accinated **A**nimals (DIVA). DIVA is a European wide surveillance strategy, that Snaccine must be compatible with. We addressed this by limiting our vaccine to encode only the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein. This enables the use of simple diagnostic tests to distinguish vaccine-induced immunity from natural infection. In the case of a natural infection, the immune system responds with multiple proteins, while ours expresses only one. With simple PCR, and ELISA diagnostics, Snaccine can be traced.<br/><br/>
- **The Regulatory Perspective (RIVM):** Our consultation with the RIVM GMO Office highlighted a biosafety risk. The experts warned that the genetic insert itself is a key factor in a GMO's risk classification, as it is assessed based on the organism of origin. HPAI is highly pathogenic, which raises the risk classification. Choosing to express only a single, non-infectious component like the HA protein inherently lowers the product's risk profile.<br/><br/>
- **The Economic Imperative (AVINED):** Finally, Erik de Jonge from the Dutch poultry trade organization AVINED connected these points to economics, stating that international trade is the primary barrier to widespread HPAI vaccination. Trading partners will not accept poultry from vaccinated regions without a guarantee that flocks are free from active infection. This elevated the DIVA principle from a practical tool to an absolute economic necessity for farmers.<br/>

**Pivotal Change:** <br/> 
The convergence of these perspectives drove our decision to pivot from a generic mRNA vaccine to a specific design encoding only the HA protein of the Avian Influenza virus. This single change simultaneously enables DIVA surveillance, minimizes biosafety risks, and preserves international trade compatibility, ensuring a thoughtfully designed solution for real-world challenges. <br/><br/>
This strategic pivot was directly translated into our wet lab execution. 
Our <HoverPic src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/hp/module-c-plasmid-schematic.webp" alt="Plasmid schematic" placement="top" width={600}>first plasmid</HoverPic> 
was engineered as a versatile backbone, with the space behind the RNA hairpin loop left open for any insert sequence. 
To integrate our new approach, we constructed a <HoverPic src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5649/hp/module-d-plasmid-schematic.webp" alt="Second plasmid schematic" placement="top" width={900}> second plasmid </HoverPic>. 
In this version, we inserted a sequence for Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) to serve as a proof-of-concept analogue for the HA protein. You can read more on this part of our project in this Wet Lab Section.
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown header="Integration Loop 4: Manufacturing Strategy" level={0}>

With our project's molecular biology framework established, we engaged an expert to guide the translation of our scientific design into an industrial scale. Through two iterative consultations, Dr. Ir. Luuk van Oosten, a Quality Control Scientist and QC CMC lead at Batavia Biosciences, provided the critical insights needed to shape our production strategy.

Our initial consultation provided a crucial introduction to the foundational principles of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and the regulatory landscape governing vaccine production. Luuk van Oosten highlighted the importance of downstream processing. He specified that the most critical step for ensuring product purity would be the removal of endotoxins (LPS) released during the lysis of the _E. coli_ host.

Building upon this, our second discussion applied these concepts directly to Snaccine. We addressed the complexities of moving from laboratory to industrial volumes, particularly the "scale-up effect" (the non-linear variability in biological systems where yields and the ratio of infectious to non-infectious particles can decrease unpredictably).

**Pivotal Change:** <br/>
Based on this input, we outlined a multi-step downstream purification process to achieve a safe and pure final product:

</BoxGrid>

</Dropdown>

<Dropdown header = "Integration Loop 5: Formulation Challenge" level={0}>

Our initial design centered on what we assumed was the most straightforward oral delivery method: mixing Snaccine with poultry feed. During our discussions with Dr. Luuk van Oosten, he explained that the choice between a liquid or a freeze-dried (lyophilized) powder could not be made without the knowledge of end-users and regulatory requirements. Any decision made without this knowledge would be based on a big assumption.

Therefore, we consulted directly with downstream stakeholders, whose feedback was clearly pointing toward a new design direction.

- **The Farmer's Perspective:** Johannis Florid, a hobby farmer, highlighted a critical practical issue: chickens peck at larger items like pills or granules, making dosing unreliable. He stated that a **"powder or mix-in format for feed or water would be far more practical"** .<br/><br/>
- **The Veterinarian's Verdict:** Dr. Eline Kamerik, a practicing veterinarian, confirmed this preference, stating that for mass-administered poultry products, the industry standard is drinking water, not feed. She explained that water administration is **"more reliable as every bird gets some dose"** and is simply "easier for farmers" with large flocks. Field trial specialists corroborated this, noting that water delivery is a proven method, while feed-based vaccination remains experimental.<br/>

**New Engineering Challenge:**

We pivoted our design toward a stable, water-soluble, lyophilized powder.

However, this shift from an encapsulated product to a soluble one introduces a critical engineering challenge. Our T7 phage system was initially designed for encapsulation, a method that served a dual purpose: it shielded the phages from stomach acid in the targeted animal and functioned as an elegant biosafety measure in case of environmental spread. Without encapsulation, shed phages in manure would be naturally neutralized by the gastric acid of any non-target animal, preventing unintended vaccination.

Losing this protective encapsulation creates a design trade-off between the user-friendliness demanded by stakeholders and the original biocontainment. This dilemma forced us to consider two potential paths forward.

<OptionFork 
    leftTitle = "Option 1: Develop a Protective, Water-Soluble Formulation."
    rightTitle = "Option 2: Use Inherently Acid-Stable Phages."
    left = {
    <>
    <p>This would involve encapsulating our existing T7 phages in a pH-responsive, water-soluble coating. The powder would dissolve in water for easy administration, but the coating would protect the phages through the stomach and release them in the gut. This maintains our Safe-by-Design principle, as any phages shed into the environment would still be acid-labile, preventing the vaccination of non-target animals.</p>
    </>
    }
    right = {
    <>
    <p> We considered selecting extremophile phages that can naturally survive low pH. While this simplifies the formulation, it would compromise a key biosafety feature. Our consultations with the RIVM GMO Office prioritized biocontainment and minimizing environmental shedding. Using an acid-stable phage would mean that off-target animals exposed to shed phages in the environment could also become vaccinated, as the phages naturally survive the stomach acid.</p>
    </>
    }
/>

<br/>
**Pivotal Change:**

After weighing the options, we concluded that **Option 1 best integrates all stakeholder requirements.** It satisfies the farmer and veterinarian's need for a water-soluble powder while upholding the regulatory and ecological safety principles established earlier in our project.

Therefore, our project's primary formulation goal has been further refined: **to develop a stable, lyophilized powder of micro-encapsulated T7 phages.** This demonstrates a direct and iterative response to the full spectrum of stakeholder feedback, from the farm to the regulatory office.

<Dropdown header="Integration Loop 6: Communication" level={0}>

Our initial communication plan was based creating public material, that balances scientific accuracy with readability. A series of insightful consultations revealed the limitations of this one-way approach and reshaped our strategy into an iterative, two-way dialogue to build public trust.

- **The Science Communicator's Advice:** Dr. Charlotte Koster advised us to move beyond simply broadcasting information and instead create an iterative feedback loop. She recommended a two-way communication approach: listening to questions and concerns of the non-expert audiences, and refining transparent communication based on their feedback.<br/><br/>
- **Identifying the Channels of Trust:** Our conversations with end-users revealed how to implement this. Johannis Florid stated that he places his trust primarily in his "veterinarian and fellow farmers, rather than government authorities or complex scientific reports," which he feels do not reflect the daily reality of farm life. Eline Kamerik validated that veterinarians are a critical channel for communication and information .

**Pivotal Change:** <br/> 
We shifted our focus from creating content to listening. We engaged with 12 members of the general public and asked for their unfiltered concerns, which included practical, and safety-oriented questions. These questions now form the structure of our Q&A. Furthermore, these materials can be designed for use by trusted intermediaries, such as veterinarians, to facilitate conversations with farmers.
</Dropdown>

<Dropdown header="Communication in Practice" level={0}>

Here we put the insights from Iteration Loop 6 into direct practice. The key questions we collected are organized below in an Q&A.

### **On Performance and Logistics**

<Box>
**Q:** How does the oral mRNA vaccine compare to other vaccines for avian flu?

**A:** Snaccine is designed to overcome key limitations that other vaccinations face. Some of them are:  
| Feature                   | Traditional Vaccines                                                                 | Snaccine                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Administration            | Injection, administered in ovo (to the egg) or subcutaneously to day-old chicks                                   | Oral, mass administration. Delivered as a water-soluble powder mixed into drinking water                                                           |
| Adaptability to New Strains | Slow to update                                                                                                    | Rapidly adaptable. As an mRNA platform, the vaccine’s genetic code can be updated in a matter of weeks to precisely match new, evolving HPAI strains |
| Distribution & Logistics  | Requires a cold chain                                                                                              | Stable at room temperature                                                                                                                         |

</Box>
<br/>

<Box>

**Q:** How long will it take until the birds respond to the orally administered vaccination?

**A:** This is still unclear to us, as we are not including animals tests in our project. Based on literature review:


1. **Gut Release & Initial Activity:** The vaccine is consumed and becomes biologically active in the gut within approximately 2 to 4 hours (Abdi et al., 2016).

2.  **Measurable Antibody Production (1–2 Weeks):** The development of a detectable antibody response, measured by tools ELISA, typically takes at least 7 to 10 days.
3.  **Peak Response and Protection (2+ Weeks):** One study noted that chickens vaccinated via drinking water developed low antibody titers initially but achieved a 90% protective rate by day 34 (**Ebrahimi et al., 2020)**. Another study found that a microbeaded oral vaccine, administered via feed, gave a "delayed but enhanced and prolonged immune response" compared to conventional methods (Ola et al., 2022).

In summary, the total time from consumption to a measurable immune response is not a matter of hours but rather **approximately 7 to 14 days at the earliest**, with the response maturing and strengthening over several weeks.
</Box>
<br/>
<Box>
**Q:** For how long can the vaccine be stored, and is it stable enough for precautionary stockpiling, or does it need to be produced and administered quickly in an emergency?

**A:** Freeze-drying and encapsulation will allow the phage-based vaccine to be stored for extended periods at room temperature, making it suitable for stockpiling and eliminating the need for a cold chain. Research suggests that the phages stabilized with  tryptone and trehalose were stable for 12 months at 28°C. (Xu et al., 2023)
</Box>
<br/>

### **On Practicality and Dosing**

<Box>

**Q:** How frequently should the vaccine be administered?

**A:** Since Avian Influenza has a high mutation rate, and different strains circulate every year, a farmer could update he vaccination very year, similar to the practice done in humans. To determine, how many capsules are needed to provide immunity, we would need to learn from field trials, and simulations.
</Box> 
<br/>
<Box>
**Q:** How is it ensured that all birds are vaccinated when administering the vaccine in feed?

**A:** In other applications, such as water administration, a dye is added, which colours the beak of the birds blue upon consumption. With that, farmers can identify animals that have, or have not, been vaccinated visually.
</Box>
<br/>
<Box>
**Q:** Can an overdose occur when administering the vaccine in feed?

**A:** The dosage would be adjusted to the natural feed, or water volume consumption, to get proper dosage. However, even when an animal consumes too much, an overdose shoulc not occur. The mRNA dosage, is limited by the amount of bacteria in the gut. Once all the bacteria have been turned into vaccine prodicers, they will die, and an possible overload of phages, will be excreted, as they dont have any hosts left.
</Box>
<br/>
### **On Safety and Biology**

<Box> 
**Q:** Can a dose of mRNA accidentally ingested by another animal lead to undesirable side effects?

**A:** If an animal eats the ready-for-use capsules, yes, they can be vaccinated. Per regulation, the field trials have to be performed on contained animals. However, one the capsules have been eaten by the target animals, the side products, such as excreted mRNA vaccination will be destroyed in the stomach acid of an off-target animal, as it lacks the capsule protection.
</Box>
<br/>
<Box>
**Q:** Is the mRNA vaccine absorbed into the human body through the consumption of meat, and can it cause undesirable side effects?

**A:** No, a human would only be vaccinated, by consuming the original capsule itself. If the chicken has been vaccinated with Snaccine in its lifetime, the phages, and E. Coli hosts will naturally die, and/ or be excreted.
</Box>

<Dropdown header = "Conclusion and Reflection" level={0}>

**Limitations: The Systemic Hurdle of International Trade**

However, this stakeholder engagement also uncovered a limitation that transcends the technical pivots of our project. We learned from the poultry trade organization AVINED that the primary obstacle to widespread Avian Influenza vaccination is not the efficacy of the vaccine, but international trade.

The core issue is that even with DIVA-compatible vaccines, the required surveillance to prove a flock is free from "masked" infection is intensive and costly. For many international trade partners, it is economically simpler to import products from unvaccinated regions where an active infection is physically apparent. Our project, by aligning with current DIVA protocols, makes compliance possible, but it does not eliminate the significant financial and logistical burden.

**Future Outlook: A Catalyst for Socio-Economic and Policy Innovation**

This realization reframes the future trajectory of the Snaccine project. For large-scale the focus must expand beyond molecular biology. This leaps into a crucial socio-economic aspect of the project which would require a dedicated future analysis.

**Reflection**

HPAI was a case study to showcase the core capabilities of the Snaccine platform:

- **Long-term stability** through lyophilization. <br/><br/>
- **Large-scale administration** via drinking water.<br/><br/>
- **Ease of oral delivery**, aligning with industry practices.<br/><br/>
- **Rapid epidemic intervention** without a cold chain.

However, the true power of this platform lies in its inherent **modularity**. The bacteriophage, the bacterial host, and the mRNA insert can be adapted. This makes Snaccine a versatile vaccination platform.

Ultimately, the development of the Snaccine platform became a parallel journey in developing our own framework as responsible innovators. The future of this technology depends not only on the science we engineer into it, but on the dialogue, trust, and ethical stewardship we build around it.
